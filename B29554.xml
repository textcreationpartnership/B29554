            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>soever doth behold clearly with the eyes of his Ʋnderstanding the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of the Eternal Moderatour, and Governour of all things, he is m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately delighted with the sweetness of that Contemplation; and the more he is delighted, the farther he searcheth into them. By searching daily
<pb facs="tcp:154387:3"/> he learns the more, and is the more ready and willing to consecrate his knowledge to the publick good; and by the help of drawing and engraving to transmit his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to all posterity. The Antients discovered much, and yet left much more still to be discovered. My Ʋncle, of Pious Memory, first led by the admirable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God, devoted his mind to the study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick from his youth, and without vanity, I may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he attained to no small glory, in the happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of <hi>Chyrurgical Operations:</hi> and whilst that he chose that stupendious Miracle of Nature, the Fabrick of Mans Body to be his Subject, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template it with great delight; he collected every day new Observations, which he committed to Writing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending one day, after having revised them, to make them Publick; and I wish to God a milder Fate had spared his Life for some years, that those Productions of his might by himself in their due time have been brought forth into the world; But God disposing it otherwise, upon his untimely departure out of this Life; and dying intestate, I came to be one of his Heirs; and having been ever observant to him, and of the same Profession, I thought it would be a high offence, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve, as it were, in Cimmerian darkness the works of him, to whom I owe my education; and as his Heir I hold my self obliged to perform the desires of the deceased, which I hope in this work, I have in some measure satisfied: as also the desires of friends, who, by Letters, have earnestly requested the Publication of it, but the chief motion which hath induced me to set it forth is, that I might Dedicate it to you my most
<pb facs="tcp:154387:3"/> honored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finding it by divers Writings which he left behind him, that it was the intention of my Ʋnkle, if he had continued alive, to Consecrate this work to your Lordships; and therefore, I should be very much to blame, if I refused too perform this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in honour to his pious ashes.</p>
            <p>But that which hath ravished my Ʋnkle and my self with admiration in your fair City of <hi>Ulme</hi> is, your still more fair order of the Senatours; which in the three Estates, Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military, flourisheth in the highest degree of honour; and as the understanding in the mind, in the body the eye, and in the eye the pupill, or sight: so in <hi>Ulme,</hi> the eye of <hi>Suevia.</hi> The Senators Order, as the pupill, and sight of it directeth all things: your most excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, is free from putting an imperious yoke upon Mens consciences: your Court is free from flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and all impartiallity: your Walls are free from forreign Forces; and in your free City, speech, and all things else are free: who therefore hath not the same Veneration for you, Fathers of your Country, as he hath for the Country it self? and who doth not testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all manner of acknowledgement and submission to you. These thirty years Warrs which Christian hath waged against Christian: under the wounds of which, almost all <hi>Germany</hi> still groaneth, by your directions, under God, have not shaken our Walls, have not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated our Temples, and Altars, and have not ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Virgins; all these your most constant care, your inbard sedulity, and your high prudence, have preserved: you have vouchsafed to allow both my

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat our first Parents were framed and Created by the Divine Power, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, strong in Body, blessed with an equal Temperament, Impregnated with a most pure flame of Life in the Oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous natural Moisture, and Absolute all manner of ways. This pressing Argument seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, That in the State of Innocency they had power to Regulate their Bodyes without any fear of Death, and fully to restore, in the same goodness, their Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, at any time wasted with heat; and to continue it even to immortality, if they had not been deceived by the Craftiness of the Serpent, and tasted of the forbidden Fruit, whereby they were afterwards obnoxious to death, and their Posterity like unto them.</p>
            <p>Those also who lived before the Flood, and were not
<pb facs="tcp:154387:5"/> at so great a distance from their Original, by the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Life, and their Innocent and Simple Diet, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only from Vegetables; some of them lived neer a thousand years, and others protracted, and extended their term of Life to many Ages; but after that, when Gluttony, and Intemperance provoked mens appetites, with divers sorts of Dishes, and the unlawful use of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery did by degrees debilitate their Bodies, and exhaust their Spirits; the length of their days was very much shortned, and their Lives were terminated in an hundred and twenty years: for as a thick Cloud doth imbibe and obscure the Rays of the Sun, so a vitious habit of body doth Cloud, and Obscure the Light of our Body, and Lamp of Life: and thus daily necessity gave a beginning to the Therapeutical part of Physick, whilst circumspect Fathers of Families were obliged to procure some Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick helps, and easily acquired Remedies to stop, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the too hasty rigour of Death,</p>
            <p>But though many Diseases may extirpated by the strength of Nature, alone, by the due observance of the six <hi>Res non Naturales,</hi> and the Alternate use of those two great helps, of Altering and Purging Medicines; yet there are some so obstinate as not to yield to any of these, or to be remedied any other way than by Chyrurgical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, by dividing what is united, by uniting what is disjoyned, and by extirpating what is superfluous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true saying of <hi>Hippocrates. Diseases which Medicines cure not, the Knife cureth; what the Knife cures not, Fire cureth; what the Fire cures not, they are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed uncurable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Operations of Chyrurgery, both in former times, and at present, almost an infinite number of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Promoters of Physick, <hi>Aegyptians, Graecians, Ara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bians, Latines, Italians, French,</hi> and of most Nations by reason of the necessity of them, and the benefit accr<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

These following forty three Chyrurgical Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for the accurate delineation of the Instruments, their Form, and Magnitude, the faithful Demonstration of the manner of Working, and the useful Observations added to them, not unworthy, perhaps, to see light, I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, for the common good of Mankind; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering what with my own eyes, and hands, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proved, and experienced: that according to the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of my abilities, and the smalness of my Talent, I might render some service to Posterity; especially in the Reading of <hi>Hieronimus Fabritius,</hi> whose words, and footsteps I follow here, and in my Practise.

                  <hi>The first Table.</hi> Of Pipes, solid and cutting tools of Iron, whereby Fontanels are made with fire.</head>
               <p>THE I. Figure is an Iron Instrument, which <hi>Hieron. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius ab Aquapendente,</hi> concerning a Fontanel in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronal suture, calls a small Pipe, and the place of the Fontanel being found and marked with ink, he forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thrusts it on with his left hand; that by the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the natural coldness of the Pipe, the heat of the red hot iron, (Figure II. following) and the pain thence arising, might be palliated; and the parts adjoining might be defended from the injury of the fire.</p>
               <p>The II. Figure is a solid and uniform iron instrument, without a handle (yet one of bone or wood may be fitted for it, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Pipe hath) which being well fired, and with the right hand thrust into the aforesaid Pipe, burns a fontanel. With these two iron instruments Fontanels are made only in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of mans body; namely, when the sick are not fearfull of a red hot iron, or the Chyrurgian hath not the <hi>capsula</hi> of <hi>Iulius Casseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Placentinus,</hi> to hide his actual cautery with.</p>

               <p>The III. Figure is also an iron Pipe, yet somewhat deeper then the former, to receive the instrument that followeth next.</p>
               <p>The IV. Figure is an instrument plainly hollow and cutting; by which, being made red hot, and thrust into the Pipe preceding, we make a fontanel, where the coronal and sagittal sutures meet; not only burning, but cutting also by the sharp point of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the end thereof. This when it toucheth the Skul must be turned about, that it may make some print upon the Skul-bone. Many dislike the use of this instrument, not only for the pain they say it causeth, but for fear of the dangerous inflammation in the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> which afterwards may easily be communicated to the <hi>Dura mater</hi> which is under it, by the affinity of the sutures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore modern Chyrurgians rejecting this, use instead thereof one that is solid and uniform; (whose form you shall find in the II. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this Table) yet in my judgment the hollow instrument is to be preferred, because that solid instrument may far more easily bring the foresaid inconveniences: I add that burning of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a solid instrument proceeds too slowly, by reason of the thickness, hardness, and density of the skin of the head: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual operations, chiefly those that are performed with a red hot iron, must be done most nimbly.</p>
               <p>Figures V, and VI. are iron tools not simply cutting and hollow; but the first hath a star at the end, and the latter is made with teeth; of these two, that by reason of the star cannot at all be turned about; and this by reason of the teeth doth not cut so readily: Wherefore modern Chyrurgians, and amongst them almost the chief, <hi>Hierom Fabritius ab Aquapendente,</hi> reject these two instruments as unfit for operation.</p>
               <p>The Figures VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, taken as joined together, make the <hi>capsula,</hi> an instrument to burn Fontanels in parts placed without the head, the best of all, and the most absolute in all respects; which was invented by <hi>Iulius Casserius Placentinus,</hi> to avoid these three inconveniences; namely, heat, pain, and sight of the fire, which fearfull men, women and children are afraid of. This invention of <hi>Placentinus</hi> hides the actual cautery; which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it most suddenly causeth an Escar, so that the Patients can scarce observe it) if it be not to be preferred before potential cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; yet I think, in all right, it ought to be used in their place: For no pain is perceived at all, or burning underneath, by reason of the end of the case, and the harder lying upon it by depression, and the wonderfull swiftness in the operation; for which cause there is not any offence, in the least, to be feared of the parts near unto it.</p>

               <p>Fig. II. is a shaving knife, or straight pen knife, that cuts but of one side, and is blunt on the other, which is used when there is no fear of the parts underneath; namely, in dividing the scalp of the head as far as the skul, and in opening nodes of the French pox, especially upon the shin bone or elsewhere; again where both edges may do hurt, as in cutting the dead child in the womb into many parts, and dividing the caruncles of the matrix; and therefore is it called <hi>Scodeghino</hi> by the Italians.</p>

               <p>Fig. V. and VI. are female Trepans, of the same bigness with the precedent male; and there is no other difference between these and that; but that these want a pin, and so are called females. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we use these females we must make some print upon the skul with the male, that the females may stand the faster upon it.

               <p>The invention of shoulders that hinder the Trepans from sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the membranes of the brain, or into the substance of it, is an argument of the excellent wisdom of <hi>Hierom Fabritius ab Aquapendente;</hi> for though some of the modern Chyrurgians, as <hi>Vid.

               <p>Fig. VI. is the other part of the Trepan, which is called the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or part to turn it with; and there is a hole cut in it, by means whereof the ends of the Trepans, wrapt about with cotton, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily

               <p>FIG.

The triangular part of this instrument may be used also for the small Trepan, with which <hi>Guilhelmus Fabritius H laanus,</hi> perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated almost the first table before he applied the Triploides, with a screw.</p>
               <p>Fig II. is a Levitor which I use in depressions of the skul, this raiseth with more force then the other described Table II Fig VII, because it hath its firmness, not only in the hand of him that raiseth it, but also in the head.</p>
               <p>Fig. III. is an instrument called a Triploides, from the threefold basis that it hath: if the depression of the skul be so great that the precedent Levitors are too weak to serve the turn, I let down the Levitor of the Triploides <hi>(b)</hi> if there be room enough, and I raise the bone pressed down, upright perpendicularly; but if there be no place for this Levitor, the middle depression must be perforated with the piercer of the Triploides <hi>(a,)</hi> beyond the Diplois, and be elevated the way mentioned, taking especial care that the wimble perforate not both Tables of the skul, and so prick the <hi>dura mater.</hi> See <hi>Guil.

(A) they take forth the peece of the bone which is corrupt and movable, also darts and bullets and the fragments of them; and all tents and hairs, and all extraneous things of that kind, which are found in wounds. The same thing is performed with instruments printed Tab. XI. Fig. III. and VI. either of which is to be used as opportunity serves. Also this part of the puller serves singularly well to pull out hairs from the ey-lids, which prick the eys. Besides the foresaid uses it is good, for it serves for to wait on Physick, that is to make women fair; for with this women, especially that belong to the Court, pull out by the roots hairs in their ey-brows, and from other parts of their bodies. Note that if a small bone, or something that is accidental in the throat, is to be taken forth; this part of the instrument must be made twice as big as it is here printed. The broader part of it (B) serves to spread plaisters upon linnen or leather, for want of a <hi>spatula;</hi> as also for a safe separation of the <hi>Pericranium</hi> from the bone, before the <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> and scraping instrument be applied to the skull, when there is a defect of nails of the hands of the thumb and fore-finger a little too short; or there wants a haft of that pen-knife printed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath Tab.

Yet with the longer nails, the <hi>Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is much safer drawn off from the skul, then by the haft of the foresaid pen-knife, or by the parting knife of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> or by this broad part of the puller.</p>

As for example a hollow one, as you see Fig. III, IV, V, and VI, a half moon, as Fig. VII. sharp pointed as Fig. VIII; lastly a plain one as Fig. IX, and X. The Chyrurgian must have four scraping tools at least, of each form, alwaies ready, lest for want of them he be constrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them from others; or may lose the occasion of his operation, which every man knows to be desperate to the danger of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and loss of his own reputation. When a rotten bone is to be scraped in the extream parts, as the thigh, the shin bone, the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bone, or the arm bone, greater and stronger rasping tools must be provided for them. Now every rasping instrument is made of most pure steel, that it may have an edge that will perfectly rasp away. The Ancients did fit the proper hafts to every rasping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument; but the modern Chyrurgians take a contrary course yet, in my judgment not so right as it ought to be, for they provide but one handle of wood or bones, at the bottom whereof the hole hath a screw, wherewith it receives all the ends of the rasping tools that are turned with screws equally; as you may see clearly by Fig. III. and by the rest.</p>

When the most famous <hi>Hierom. Fabritius, ab Aquapendente,</hi> makes mention of this instrument in his Chirurgery concerning the jaws, he understands some kind of instrument that is long and slender, which is twofold, one streight, shadowed forth Table IX▪ Fig. X. another crooked, as this is; yet both of them for their faculty of taking and drawing forth, may well deserve the name of pullers.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. is a pipe of silver, crooked, that it may be put into the throat; it is as thick as a Swans quil, and one foot long and a half, or thereabouts: it is all full of holes, and at the end of it, it hath a sponge that is new, and as great as a small nut, firmly bound to it. Which <hi>Guill. Fabritius Hildanus,</hi> Cent. 1. Observ. 16. useth with happy success to draw out thorns out of the jaws, and middle of the wesand pipe; where he teacheth the manner of the operation by the pipe here printed. The following iron instruments are used for hollow teeth, or such as are loose, or that are very painfull sometimes, to take them forth when people are in the most bitter pains. Whence</p>
               <p>Fig. III. is a pair of Pincers, named a Pellican, because the beck of it is like the bill of the Pellican, a bird so called; but they use it to draw forth the grinding teeth.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. is a common pair of pincers for the teeth, the Italians call it <hi>cagnolo,</hi> because it holds as fast as a dog bites.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. is a pair of pincers that represents a Crows bill; with which the roots of the teeth are drawn forth: Of which <hi>Cornelius Celsus</hi> (whom, as being admirable in all Chirurgical operations, <hi>Fabritius ab Aquapendente</hi> counsels us to study in both night and day) <hi>Lib.</hi> 7: <hi>cap.</hi> 12. concerning teeth, writes thus; as oft as when a tooth is taken forth, the root is left behind, that must forthwith be drawn out also with a pair of pincers, the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI and VII. are the patterns of toothed pincers. that serve to pull out teeth, which neither the Pellican nor common pincers can draw forth.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII and IX, are Levitors divided in three parts, because they commonly have three spears to thrust forward and to take out the cutting teeth, and the dog teeth which are fastned in the holes of the gums with one root alone.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:154387:22"/>
               <p>Fig. X. is a tooth-picker, with which the gum is separated from the teeth, that they may be pulled out with less danger and trouble. That therefore the drawing out of a tooth may succeed well, observing what must be observed, place the Patient on a low place, with his head lying between the Chirurgian's legs; then the Chirurgian shall cut deep round about the tooth to be pulled out, parting the gum from it with his Tooth-cutter; and if the tooth shake when it is parted from the gum, it must be shaken, and thrust out forward with the Levitor put under it; but if it stick fast, and move not after it is shaken, it must be laied hold on with the toothed pincers, and pulled forth (sometimes this way, sometimes that, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, scituation, and figure of the tooth shall seem to require. In the use of these toothed pincers (saith <hi>Ambros. Paraeus Lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 27.) I should desire the Tooth-drawer to be very expert and industrious; for with these, unless a man be very cunning, and know the use of them, it can scarce be avoided, but that at one pull he shall bring out three teeth, and ofttimes leave that tooth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken that causeth the pain.</p>
               <p>Fig. XI. is a Tunnel or a pipe of silver, whose narrower part is thrust between the outmost gum of the Patient, who hath his teeth fast shut together, and the broader end receives liquid meats and drinks and lets them down to the <hi>oesophagus.</hi>

               <p>Fig. IV. is an ear Syringe, called <hi>Otenchyta,</hi> whereby liquors are injected into the organs of hearing, to cleanse and heal ulcers there.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. is called <hi>Enterenchyta,</hi> namely a pipe of latten crooked like to a Catheter; which let them care to provide, who would rather give themselves a clyster, than receive it from any one else; especially if often use of clysters be needfull, by reason of the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the guts; especially of the right gut.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. is the lock of the said crooked pipe B, Fig. V. by help whereof the liquor of the clyster in the bladder, which about the letter A Fig. V. is to be tied after the vulgar manner, is held so long as the Patient pleases, as he will open or shut the pipe.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. is a nail with a broad head <hi>(c)</hi> Fig. V. which is screwed into the lock B, Fig. V. that nothing of the clyster, in turning the key about, may run forth, which may foul the sheets. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, as it appears to any man, differs much from that which <hi>Iohan. Heurnius</hi> in his method <hi>ad praxin medicam, Cap. De Clystere;</hi> and <hi>Guill. Fabritius Hildanus Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Observ.</hi> 78. caused to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to inject clysters into the belly.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. is a silver cap and full of holes, which is applied to the ulcerated nipples of the breasts, that nurses may suckle the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant without any trouble. This cap is also used for wounds of the Thorax; for after that any one of the aforesaid pipes hath been thrust into the Thorax, and a piece of sponge is put into the orifice of the pipe near the shoulder; this cap is put upon it that the matter, almost every moment, may sweat through the holes of it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and without any loss of strength.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX and X. are candles made of strong double thread and white wax (to which a little Turpentine is added, that they may not break so soon) and these are to be ready for use when the urine is stopped by a caruncle in the urinary passage, which must be cured. <hi>The candle</hi> Fig. IX. <hi>is broken, lest in the drawing forth of the candle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, some piece of wax, which sometimes hath no wick in the middle, should be left in the passage, and thereby the difficulty of making water could be greater.</hi> Wherefore the Chyrurgian shall cut off, with his pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that part which is broken at the end of the candle; and then he shall thrust into the urinary passage the said candle, so far as need shall require, first anointing it with oyl of sweet almonds.</p>

                  <hi>The XIV. Table.</hi> Of <hi>Syringotomi,</hi> and the needle wherewith the scrotum is perforated after the cutting of a Hernia (used at Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia) and the bottom of a more sloping fistula; of the catheter, the directory, and two instruments wherewith bullets are taken forth of wounds made with gun shot.</head>
               <p>FIG. I. is a crooked knife, which upon the inside <hi>(a)</hi> hath an edge, and on the outside <hi>(b)</hi> it is blunt, namely a <hi>Syringoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> which at one end <hi>(c)</hi> pricks and cuts; this we use in any fistula that hath but one passage, that the end of the fistula may be perforated; and afterwards the space between one hole and another may be cut asunder; at the point hereof we must fasten a button made of white wax, wherewith the pen-knife thrust into the fistula may come to the bottom, without any hindrance, pain or hurt.</p>
               <p>Fig. II and III. are pen-knives to cut fistulaes; both of which are blunt at one end, and have a bullet of iron well pollished at the other end. With these the whole passage of deep fistulaes are to be cut.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. is a knife to cut fistulaes, wherewith the wounds of the abdomen are dilated, that the intestines slipt down and swoln with winds may be commodiously thrust back again. It hath a button at one end far greater then the two former knives have, lest being thrust into the wound it should hurt the intestines.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. is a needle, or iron instrument, with a double edge; which they of <hi>Nursia,</hi> in my time in <hi>Italy,</hi> in this part of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery (which cures Hernias with cutting forth the testicle) being excellent well skilled, and in that respect the most famous gelders, thrust the wound of the groin to the bottom of the scrotum; which with the point of the instrument (to which alwaies men ought to fasten a small button of white wax, for the reason abovesaid) they perforate; whereby the corrupt matter, which by the wound of the groin descends to the scrotum, may be purged forth. This operation because it is fearfull enough, and is not without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test danger of life <hi>(which the Authours of it knew well; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take on those they would cure, but as dead men.)</hi> I will open to such that are studious of Chyrurgery, another use of this instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is very safe. Namely, with this are cut the sloping ends of sinuous ulcers, for which cause fistulaes cannot be cleansed,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154387:27"/> unless the Patient be so scituated that his head be downwards and his heels upwards, and the corruption may run forth of its own motion. For it is known that such hollow sores which have not yet contracted a callous, whereof also we here speak, can be cured only by glutinative medicaments, and convenient ligature. So the matter collected in the hollow sinews may find a daily passage out. But since that scituation with the heels upward and head downward is troublesom enough, with this instrument, to whose sharp end a small button of wax must be fastned, the bottom of the hollow ulcer is perforated (leaving the partition between the holes untouched) that the matter may run forth by the lower hole, and the partitions between the sinuous ulcers may be glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. is a Catheter or a Probe; by which, being thrust in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the passage of the yard, and into the bladder, we prove the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most turnings of the bladder, wherein the stone useth to lie hid, wherewith oftentimes man's nature is tormented. The Greeks call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and it is used to make the urine come forth when it is stopped. It is made of silver that it may be bent, and it is free from all roughness, lest the part that is most exquisite in feeling, should be affected with the Catheter in the passage, and that it may enter into the bladder without pain: it is perforated with many holes at the end, that the pin being drawn back, the urine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bladder may freely come forth by the pipe without any difficulty. <hi>Note</hi> that the pin is not thrust into the pipe, that as it were by force of vacuum it might draw after it the urine sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but that the urine should not presently run forth, whilest the cutter for the stone, or the Physitian seeks after the stone that lies hid. <hi>Celsus</hi> describes the magnitude of the Catheter, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. see Table XXXIX. Fig. IX.</p>
               <p>Fig▪ VII. is a silver Probe which must be so bent, that its fissure which it hath in the middle, as far as the end of it, may be on the back side or gibbous part thereof: The Latines call it a <hi>Directory;</hi> because, being thrust into the yard, it doth most exactly shew the neck of the bladder; and upon that must incision be made to take the stone out of the bladder.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. is a latten instrument, wherewith the stone is taken forth which remains in the urinary passage; namely a Probe, which on that part where it is made hollow like a spoon for the ears, is put into the conduit of the yard, so that it may pass beyond the small stone above it, and may lay hold on it with its lip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154387:27"/> this being done, oyl of sweet almonds is poured through the hollow passage of the pin of the Probe, which hath a large orifice, into the Urinary passage, that it may become slippery; afterwards the Probe is gently drawn forth, and the conduit is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed behind the stone with the finger, untill it be driven forth of the Urinary passage.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. is an instrument the most fit to take forth bullets out of a wound. It is made of the best steel, and it consists of three parts; namely, of two small pipes and a piercer. The outward pipe <hi>(a)</hi> can shut in the innermost pipe; which at one end is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two spoons of iron <hi>(b)</hi> that it may fasten the bullet, that it may not turn about with the piercer, which must be fastned into it. The Piercer <hi>(c)</hi> is most sharp and somewhat longer than its two pipes; which by the hole of the handle <hi>(d)</hi> may be seen to be thrust into the pipe.</p>
               <p>Fig. X. is a Piercer printed without its pipes.</p>
               <p>Fig. XI. is the same instrument with the former, (but that it wants a Piercer) wherewith bullets are drawn forth; it consists of two parts of the pipe <hi>(a)</hi> and the stile <hi>(b)</hi> which is solid; which at the other end is divided into two spoons which may take in the bullet betwixt them. This instrument doth the very same, that the instrument of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> in the following Table doth.</p>
               <p>Fig. XII. is the pipe of the precedent instrument by it self.</p>
               <p>Fig. XIII. is the stile of the instrument which is solid half way; and at one end representing the form of spoons with teeth; at the other end like screws, that are bossed with a hilt and a button.</p>
               <p>Fig. XIV. is the hilt of the stile, with its little button, which is round and hollow.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV. of this Table, must be made a third part greater than they are here printed.</p>

                  <hi>The XV. Table.</hi> Of other iron instruments fit to take out musket bullets; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Alphonsus's instrument; the Goose bill pincers, with and without a screw; the little hook; the piercer with a pipe; and the spatula which represents a Goose bill.</head>
               <p>FIG. I, II and III. is an instrument called an <hi>Alphonsiae,</hi> made fit to take out bullets out of wounds; which <hi>Alphonsus Terrius,</hi> a Physitian of Naples, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de vulner sclopet. cap.</hi> 3. describes in these words. Yet that instrument which men call the Cranes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill, must not be forgotten, for that it is also an excellent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw forth any thing, and commended by all both old and new Chyrurgians; wherewith not only small bullets are taken out of the most difficult places, but also pieces of Armour, and many other things. To this we (that it may be more commodiously and firmly held in the hand, and so bullets and other strange things in wounds may be found out more certainly) have added rings for pincers, after this fashion. The ring A of the first Figure, thrust to the former part of it, shuts the instrument; the ring B of the second Figure being drawn back to the handle, the instrument is opened. The third Figure is the instrument which now holds the bullet.</p>
               <p>The Figures of the following instruments, are taken forth of the Treatise of <hi>Barthol. Maggius,</hi> concerning the cure of wounds made by bullets from great and small guns.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. is a pair of pincers with a Goose-bill, which hath a screw about the handle, that it may lay fast hold of the bullet.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. is a little iron hook which serveth to bring forth bullets.</p>
               <p>Fig, VI. is a pair of pincers with a Goose-bill, which if it had a screw were like to the former.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. is a most sharp piercer, in its pipe, with which gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot are taken forth.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. is the piercer without the pipe.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. is a spatula with a Goose-bill; provided to receive and take forth small bullets.</p>
               <p>The Alphonsine instrument and Goose-bill pincers, must be made a third part greater; but the pipe with the piercer must be as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154387:29"/> great again. <hi>Ambros. Paraeus</hi> in his Chyrurgery hath described more instruments to the life, where he treats of wounds by gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot; but they are not better for these purposes: and so hath <hi>Guill. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. I. Observat. LXXXIX.</hi> Wherefore there are divers sorts of instruments that are good to take out bullets from the wounded parts, according to the variety of the wound, and the fashion of the body that must be taken out: whereof some lay hold and draw out, either as they are sharp and so only stuck into the bullets (Fig. VIII.) or as they are dented at the end; and some are streight (Table IV. Figure I. Table IX. Figure VI. and in this Table Figure I.) and others are crooked (Table IX. Figure X.) to be used as the bullet went in streight or crookedly; some take and receive the bullet in, as they are broader and hollow at the end; (Figure IV, V, VI and IX.) others lay hold and take it in together (Table XIV. Fig. IX.) But if the bullet found by the Probe must be drawn forth by a pair of Pincers, principal care must be had that the lips of the wound, and the inward parts of it (namely the Arteries, Veins, Nerves and Tendans) be not hurt nor laied hold of: for if this be done most cruel pains, and great inflammations, with great danger of life, are produced; besides a most fearfull flux of blood following. Wherefore to prevent such symptoms, let the Pincers never be opened, unless you feel the bullet at the end of it; for then must the Pincers be opened, and the bullet laid hold on by them, and pulled forth.</p>

               <p>Fig. IV. is the stile which is made red hot, and is thrust into the perforated pipes; and into the solid pipe also to dry up the internal Emrods, and those that are swoln; and to cure the ulcers of the right gut, be they superficial or deep.</p>

See the fashion of this operation in <hi>Galen. comm. in Lib. Hippoc. de Articulis.</hi> Also this Ladder hath four pullies, for the use of <hi>Nileus</hi> his <hi>Plinthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which shall be explained underneath Fig. V.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. is the form of an instrument called <hi>Glossocomon,</hi> for the fractures of the thigh and the leg, to hold them fast together when the Patient is removed from his bed, whereon he lieth, into another bed till that be made; and it is exceeding fit for it. The description of this <hi>Glossocomon</hi> found in <hi>Galen, comm. ltb. Hippocr. de Fracturis,</hi> is thus: This instrument called <hi>Glossocomon</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the latter Physitians to hold fast, when the thigh or leg is broken; the making of which, and the use of it, I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex hereunto. And indeed this seems not to me to be invented to no purpose; and if either thigh or leg be broken, it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently applied, where the callous may compass it about. It hath at the lower part the Axis A, to which must be tied the ends of the strings that extend divers waies; let the strings be fastned upon the utmost parts of the bone that is cured; and make them so of two bands B and C, that both of them may have four ends, two on the right side F, and as many on the left side G. From those ends, those things which are belonging to the lower string B, must be drawn to the axletree, by the holes made in the lower part of the <hi>Glossocomon</hi> D; and those things thar belong to the uppermost string, must first proceed to the upper parts; then they also must be put through the perforated sides of the <hi>Glossocomon,</hi> whereby they are fastned in the holes of the screw F; but on both sides, on the outside of the <hi>Glossocomon</hi> F and G, the ends of the upper string C must be carried to the axis. For these things being so ordered, one turning about of the axis, will equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend both strings, that downward which is bound to the lower part of the broken bone; but the other upward so, that where the leg lieth you may afterwards daily correct this stretching of the strings divers waies, by extending more or less forcibly. Therefore the axis extends the string B, which is in the lower part, drawing directly; but that in C, which is in the upper part, it extends by the interceding of another motion; the Greeks say it is done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Figure shews the extension of the thigh that is diminished; but if the leg be diminished, the upper string C must be fastned below the knee, and the lower above the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154387:35"/> ankles; and so the leg is to be kept extended divers waies.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. is a drawing instrument called <hi>Plintheum Nilei;</hi> and it is made after the pattern of those which are called long and square wind-lasts. This instrument hath two sides <hi>(a)</hi> four hands breadth long, and a finger thick overthwart, which at both ends are compacted together with two cross boardi <hi>(b)</hi> which have in the middle the hole <hi>(c)</hi> through which the cords <hi>(h)</hi> are put. The thickness and breadth of the Transorus, is equal to the sides; but the length of them is a full hand breadth: wherefore rightly is such a joining together made, that the sides <hi>(a)</hi> may be four hands breadth long; and the Transorus <hi>(b)</hi> but one. The whole instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made long waies; yet if a man will, he may make the sides shorter then I have said, since the instrument performs its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by one axletree: Therefore the sides, in the middle, are perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with round holes, through which the axletree <hi>(d)</hi> passes, whose left end, where it passes without the side, hath a wooden handle <hi>(e.)</hi> Also in this instrument there are four iron rings <hi>(f)</hi> fastned to the sides, with as many leather strings hanging down, two at the lower part, and two at the upper part, that it may be fastned to the ladder Fig. III. To both ends of the axletree there are wheels added <hi>(g)</hi> and to their stops <hi>(i)</hi> that they may hold firm the axletree turned about by the handle. So that if the arm, out of joint, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either by a band put under the arm-pit, (Tab. XXIII Fig. II.) nor yet by a linnen cloath wrapt on a heap (Table XXIV. Fig. I.) this instrument must be tied to the ladder; and the arm must be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after the same fashion and manner, as it is found to be done in <hi>Oribasius lib. de Machinament. cap</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. is a long, hollow trunk, wherein the leg or thigh, being broken or out of joint is laid; it must be filled with Towhards, for the whole part must be laid in the hollow trunk, rather than half, <hi>Hippoc. de offic. medic.</hi> This Capsula hath the hole G at the bottom to receive the heel, and at the end a long board for the sole of the foot to rest against.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. represents the best reducing of the shoulder fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the arm pit; that is, which <hi>Fabritius ab Aquapend.</hi> describes thus. The end of the <hi>spatha</hi> must be set under the arm-pit of the shoulder out of joint, between the side and the top of the shoulder; the rest of the plank must be bound placed all at length, with the arm on the inside; first, immediately under the top of the shoulder disjointed; next above the elbow, and last upon the wrist. This being done the Patient must be set upon a seat E, and his arm bound to the plank must be fitted to the beam or pillar (Fig. II. A) by means

                  <hi>The XXIII Table.</hi> Of the setting of a shoulder broken; and the reducing of the shoulder, arm and thigh bones, put out of joint.</head>
               <p>FIG. I. teaches how to extend and to set the shoulder bone that is broken; which <hi>Hippocrates Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>de fractur. text</hi> 9. describes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecllently. Wherefore the most exact distance of the arm is this. A piece of Timber of a cubit long A, or somewhat shorter, as are the handles of spades, must be bound on both sides with the cord B, and hanged up; but the man placed upon some high stool, must so lean upon it with his hand. that the handle may be so placed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154387:38"/> under his arm-pit, that he can hardly sit down, but may remain almost hanged up. Then some one firm bolster or many C, being laid under and above it, at that height which may answer to the arm placed at a right angle; it were better to hang by a broad and soft thong of leather, or a broad band tied about it D, some heavy weight E that may gently stretch it, or else some other strong man may forcibly draw the arm downwards at the bending of the arm Fig. II. but the Physitian standing and placing one foot on a higher place, must attempt the cure, and with the palms of his hands set the bone; which truly will be easily done, for this way of extending is commendable if a man use it rightly. Others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the way that <hi>Celsus</hi> used to extend the shoulders, which he describes very darkly, <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. but <hi>Foesius</hi> hath clearly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the meaning of his words intirely, in his <hi>comm.</hi> upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> to which I think fit also to subscribe.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. is the reducing of the arm out of joint, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his mind, where the elbow is slipt forth to the inward or outward part; the distention must be so ordered that the arm may be placed at a right angle with the shoulder. But it behooves us to lift up the arm-pit with the band F put under it; and to lay the arm upon something, and about the joint to hang some weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter Fig. I. or else to press it downwards with the assistants hands, as in this Figure. <hi>But whilest the joint is hanged up, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to thrust hard with the fore-part of the palms of the hands. This Figure is convenient, whilest the arm is bound, hanged up and placed.</hi> When it slips forth on the hinder side, it must be suddenly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with the fore-part of the palms of the hands forced into its place again, which also must be observed in reducing other bones. When it slips forth into the fore part, laying a linnen cloath upon it, wrapt up in form of a ball, it is necessary at once to bend and reduce it, Table XXIV. Fig. I. But if it slip into the other, or hinder part, when it is reduced, both of these also must be done: See Table XXIV▪ Fig. I.</p>
               <p>Fig. III. shews <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his way of reducing the shoulder slipt under the arm-pit. For though that be the most excellent way of reducing, which was commended a little before, Table XXI. Fig. VI. yet this which follows comes next to it, which our old man seems to commend in these words. Wherefore they whose shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders slips often forth, may for the most part reduce it themselves. For thrusting under the arm-pits the knuckles of the fingers of the other hand, they thrust the joint upward, and they draw the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched part of the arm to their breast. Also after this manner the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154387:38"/> Physitian shall force it into its place; if the inward part of the joint be slipt forth, putting his finger under the arm pit, he shall set his head to the top of the shoulder and bring it back from the sides; but setting his knees to the binding of the elbow with his arm, he shall thrust it to the sides. But it is necessary that he who reduces it should have strong hands, or else he must do it with his hands and his head; and some other that assists him, must bring the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched part that sticks forth unto his breast.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. is the reducing of the thigh out of joint, which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> describes as it here follows. But the hip is thus reduced, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it slip forward or inward. A ladder is set in the ground, whereupon the man sits with his sound leg lightly extended, and bound about it with the best convenience; but to his leg out of joint G, there is hanged a basket H full of stones, or some earthen vessel full of water: See the Figure of it in <hi>Galen, comm.</hi> 4. <hi>in Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocr. de artic. text. lib.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>FIG. I. represents another way of reducing the elbow out of joint, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his opinion. But it is expedient to put a swathe band wound up together, or a linnen cloath folded hard, yet not very great, laid athwart on that part where the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the arm is, then to bend the arm suddenly, and as much as possibly you can, to bring the hand to the head of the shoulder; for this way is very sufficient for those who have it slipt forth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or backwards.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. the hand out of joint is reduced. Now the hand slipt forth, either to the inside or outside, but most commonly to the inside. It is a certain sign when it is slipt into the inside, for it cannot be bended; and when to the outside the fingers cannot be extended. In reducing of it place the fingers upon a Form, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Table. and let them be stretched divers waies by two persons that are assistants. That part of the bone which sticks out, must be repulsed either by the upper part of the Chyrurgians palm of his hand, or with his heel also, and be forced into the former and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154387:39"/> lower part; but from underneath near the other bone, some soft ball must be put, with the hand downward, where the laxation is on the upper part; but the hand upward, where it is on the lower part.</p>

But I provided thirteen bands that were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in length (for the thinner and lower part of the leg needs shorter swathes, but the thicker part requires longer) but they were all three overthwart fingers breadth, which I so fitted for the Capsula, which was to be set under the leg, that part of every lower band, should cover about half the upper band. This being done, I laid the leg which was to be bound into the Capsula co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with bands; then I turned the ends of the lowermost band cross waies upwards; afterwards the ends of the band which was next to the lowermost, and so on till I came to the uppermost, whose ends I fastned with a double knot; see Table XXIX.

Fig. X. brought round about; and whereof more shall be said in the cure of the fracture) must be laid under it.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. is a piece of the thigh taken forth of the wound, and printed both on the left and right side of it, that the rottenness of it may be better seen and considered.</p>
               <p>Fig. X. is a broken thigh bound with a hatching ligature brought cross waies, and is to be laid in the long Trunk, Table XXI. Fig VI. For if any man puts a hollow case under it, that goes not higher than the ham, he shall do more harm than good. For it will not hinder the moving of the body nor of the leg, without the thigh moving; but being applied to the ham it will bring trouble, and force one to that there is no need of. For there is no need for the knee to bend. For if any man when his thigh is bound or his leg shall bend his knee, he shall put all the ligature out of order; and then it is necessary that the muscles should change their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and the broken bones must be moved out of their places. Wherefore, first we must indeavour to extend the ham. Therefore a hollow Trunk will be usefull, which being put under from the hip to the foot, may hold it likewise; and principally, if a loose ligature be put about to the ham with the Trunk, as children use to be swathed in their Cradles. For when the thigh shall be wrinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to the upper or the lower side, <hi>(either whilest the Patient is a sleep, or when he goes to sit down, or staies whilest his bed is made)</hi> in such cases it will be better contain'd in a hollow case. Wherefore a hollow case must be made for him from the top to the bottom, or else none at all. Moreover great care must be had for the bottom of his heel, that it may be fitly scituated both in fractures of the leg and thigh. For if the foot hang, when the rest of the leg is fast bound, of necessity the bones must appear in the fore-part of the shin, in the part where it bunches forth; and that the more, the greater a man's heel naturally is. <hi>Hippocrates de fracturis femoris,</hi> see Table XXVI.

               <p>
                  <hi>Guillielmus Fabritius Hildanus</hi> hath written a most learned work, concerning the cure of a Gangrene and a Sphacelus, which young Chyrurgians must read carefully over and over again very often, (besides the way of ligature by swathe bands about mutilated parts, which I have here set down for their sakes) they shall find there all things necessary for the cutting off of a Limb. He, indeed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove, by many reasons, that a mortified part cannot be taken off quickly, safely, and without pain, if any corruption be left behind, to be consumed by red hot burning irons: Yet in my judgment all those reasons do not prove that the amputation of the part affected, that is taught by <hi>Hierom. Fabritius ab Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente,</hi> doth never succeed well: And far less do they demonstrate, that this amputation should be of less value, than that which is perforated in the quick part; considering, that amputation made in the sound part, cannot be perforated without pain; whether the fleshy parts be cut with a rasour, or with a cautery with a sharp knife: Nor yet safely, because the quick part, bound with a band, easily mortifies; also amputation upon a sound part, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be acurately performed; but that sometimes the parts that lie deeper, shall be left more corrupted than the outward parts; which if it happen, than we must either atrempt to cut again, which were horrible; or else the remaining corruption, must be consumed with red hot irons, according to the latter Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Not quickly, because a longer time is required to draw forth the Arteries with an instrument, and to bind them with a thtead <hi>(and if the Ligature be removed, sometimes such a flux of blood follows, that unless the vessels be touched with actual Cauteries, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the cause of the Patient's death)</hi> than to cauterize the wound presently with red hot irons: That I may not say the operation is the more prolong'd, if after the amputation taught by <hi>Hildanus</hi> and the Ancients, any corruption remains. Wherefore, relying upon reasons and happy experience, I determine that the way of <hi>Hieron. Fabritius ab Aquapendente,</hi> to cut off any, is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the operation of other Ancients.</p>
               <p>But if the strength of the Patient, by reason of putrid vapours, and a precedent flux of blood, is so weak that we are sure he will faint in the operation; for that time we must abstain from ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, because it is more excusable to leave the Patient so, than to kill him knowingly. But when there is no hopes left, unless the part be cut off, what must the Chyrurgian do? Let him touch the mortified part, morning and evening daily, with very red hot
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154387:45"/> irons, to drink up the putrid humours, that the sphacelus may not creep up higher; also let him give to the Patient, to take down Medicaments against poison, which may drive the corrupt vapours from his heart, and restore his strength by refreshing his spirits; and also let him apply such things to the external Region of his heart. When his forces are something refreshed (for his former forces are looked for with certain danger of his life) foretelling the danger, let him proceed to his operation desired. For it is better, the forces thus remaining, to try this doubtfull and most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of cure, rather than none at all. Whilest I studied Physick at <hi>Padua,</hi> a certain Lord of <hi>Vincen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is</hi> refused to cut off, because of his want of forces, by reason of his great loss of blood; but with red hot irons often applied, he hindred the corruption from spreading, and with Medicaments outward and inward he did corroborate him, and refreshed his spirits as much as possibly he could: At last, the Patient being ignorant of it, he cut the mortified part round about with a knife. When that fell down, he consumed the rest of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with actual cauteries; and to remove the Eschar he applied <hi>Vnguentum Egyptiacum simplex.</hi> The third day after the amputation of the lower part of the foot, as far as the fracture, the Patient complained of an extream pain of his great toe of his right foot; the Chyrurgian smiling, said that he wondred that he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the pain of that toe which was buried above three daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; with these words the Patient was so frighted, that he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a grievous swound. When the Eschar was taken away, and the muscles, as they use to do, were drawn upwards, the bones stuck out four fingers breadth; which being daily covered with dry thin rags, and drying powders, in two moneths time they were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the sound bones. That the precedent Tables, and that which follows next, which treats of the cure of fractures and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locations, may be better understood, I shall briefly set down the general cure of them out of <hi>Hieron.

                  <head>The cure of a simple dislocation.</head>
                  <p>IT is done by five Intentions, 1. Extension. 2. Reposition. 3. Deligation. 4. Deposition of the part dislocated. 5. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154387:46"/> of the part. Now Extension will be easily made if four things be observed: First, Time: Secondly, fit Instruments: Thirdly, Manner: And fourthly, the quantity of the extension. The time is propounded by <hi>Hippocrates, de Artic.</hi> 64. namely, that it should be done presently after it is put out of joint, whilest the part is yet hot. But if extension cannot be made presently, for want of a Chyrurgian or Physitian, we must do it the second or third day; unless we be forced to desist, by reason of the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that comes first upon it. But on the fourth day, by reason of great pains, nothing must be attempted; for it is observed, that if we attempt then to reduce it, it will not succeed well, but many inconveniences will follow it. Whence <hi>Fallopius de Luxationibus, Cap.</hi> 3. saith, I admonish you that you alwaies have a care to the time; which, at most, must not exceed three daies; and if the third day be past, the term of inflammation must be expected; and the time when there is no danger of inflammation, and that is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> warns us 4. <hi>de Artic.</hi> 65. untill which time the sick man is to be kept very low, with fasting, or rather with a very thin diet. Wherefore if extension cannot be made the first three daies, we must wait till the seventh day. The time when you may reduce, is the first, second, or third day; or else the seventh, eighth, or ninth day; but on the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and the rest it is not safe; because then the callous is bred. But before we come to extension, the joint must be prepared to prevent pain, and to make the reduction easie, by heating, fastning and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the parts of the joint; namely, the Muscles, Tendans and Ligaments; for if they be fastned, they will be drawn the more easily and without pain. But heating and softning of the joint, is made either by rubbing, or by pouring on much hot water, or water and oil; or the decoction of Mallows, Marish-Mallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We use chafing conveniently, upon those places where water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be poured easily; but it must be done with the hand, smeared with some oils or fat matter, as with common oil, or Hogs-grease that is not salted at all. <hi>Spigelius</hi> in his publick Lectures saith, that for to cure a dislocation, a Bath of sweet water can do so much, that there is nothing better than it.</p>

                     </gap> hands of the Chyrurgian or his servants, which must be moderately anointed with some soft unguent, or with oil of roses. Reduction is made either by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyration, or by forcing it back to the opposite part to which it is fallen. These motions are not alwaies necessary, for sometimes, when extension is made, if the muscles that were before contracted be only relaxed, the joint will easily of its own accord return into its natural place.</p>
                  <p>Now the signs of a part that are well set, are these: First a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shape of the part, when there is no hollowness nor swelling that appears about the joint, as there did before it was set; but in all things it must be like the sound part, or not far unlike by reason
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154387:47"/> of a flux of humours. Secondly, there must be abatement of pain, which is an inseparable sign, for alwaies when the pain is ended, it is a sign that the bone is reduced; but it follows not on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the bone is reduced, therefore the pain is ended; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the pain may abide, because the muscles were very much hurt at first. Thirdly, as some say, the crack that is perceived by the Patient, and the standers by, when the bone falls into his socket; but this is a false mark, and never to be wished for, because that crack is sometimes made, when the joints are extended and drawn too far; ofttimes also the crack is made, when the brims of the bone are broken by the mutual clashing of the bones, after which there succeeds difficulty in motion.</p>
                  <p>In the first binding and all the rest, two things are principally to be observed; namely, the figure of the part affected, and the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self; which will preserve the joint in its socket, and will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inflammation that is near at hand.</p>
                  <p>In the figure we must observe the fashion of the joint, not only that is reduced, but also of the whole part; for as some figures are natural and without pain, so some are unnatural and painfull: The figure of the arm without pain, is bended, as of the foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right forth, Table XXVI. Figure II and III. <hi>But note that the said Figure must be ordered to the part before it be bound: namely, that the bands be not too loose, or bound too hard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ligature must be made with linnen bands, because they bind better than those that are made of woollen; they must be soft, that they may cause no pain: they must be equal, that they may bind equally every where; and they must be clean, that the humours which issue forth of the joint, may be known by the colours. The latitude of the bands doth vary according to the parts that must be bound; for the thicker parts require the broader bands; and the thinner those that are narrower. In the thicker parts (namely, the thigh and the knee) they must be four fingers breadth of the sick party, broad; in the thinner parts (as the leg, shoulder, arm and hand) three; in the most slender parts (as the fingers) they must be, at the least, two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad.</p>
                  <p>Bands are distinguished by <hi>Galen</hi> into inward bands, such as bind the joint under the plaisters, and are called under-binders; and outward bands that are put above the plaisters: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> useth two outward bands, and two inward; though sometimes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154387:47"/> one band sufficeth; namely, when the joint is not easie to slip out.</p>
                  <p>The length of the bands is divers, in respect of the variety of parts to be bound; upon the arm the length of the bands must be three cubits (by a cubit I understand the space from the top of the middle finger of the sick party, so far as the joint of the elbow) for the legs, they must be four cubits; for the shoulder, nine; for the thigh, twelve; and for the fingers, less by two fingers length. The bands, that beside their binding they may hinder inflammation, must be wet with sharp Wine and oil of Roses mingled together; because, being dry, they will not stick long fast together. Others moderately anoint the bands, very happily, with the moist cerat of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which <hi>Galen</hi> describes <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de compos. med. per Gen. Cap.</hi> 4. It is called <hi>Ceratum,</hi> from the wax that is mingled with it; and moist, because it is soft by reason of the oil.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of the wax and oil, is this: To take one part part wax, and two of oil; or take one ounce of white wax, and two of oil of Roses. Here we must avoid those medicaments that are made of astringent powders, and the white of an egg; because they either cool and dry the joint too much, that the bending of it is hindred; or they hinder the humours, that are flowed into it, to come forth. The binding of the joint dislocated, is common to fractures; but after what manner it must be made, I shall shew underneath, in the cure of a simple fracture, and Table XXIX.</p>
                  <p>The Deposition of the part is threefold, Alligation, Suspension, and Collocation: Alligation as according to <hi>Paulus,</hi> the Arm is bound to the Thorax, in a laxation or fracture of the shoulder or arm. Suspension, as when the arm is hanged, by a linnen cloath put about the neck. Collocation, as when we place the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, upon any part of the body, as the Arm upon the Thorax, or upon some furniture laid into a capsula. We use Alligation and Suspension for the upper parts; but Collocation for the lower parts. But the Deposition must be after the mean figure of the part; soft (therefore the case is filled with hards, that the Patient may be at ease) equal (for a great inconvenience may arise out of a small ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality) and it must lie upwards, that the humours may not run to the affected part, and cause inflammation Table XXVI.

To know the time when dislocations are cured, you must understand that there are three degrees of joints; for some are small, and easily to be reduced; some are mean, and of more concernment; others are great, and hard to be reduced. The cure of the first joints of any finger, is performed in fourteen daies; of the second joints of any finger or toe, at the end of the foot or hand, in twenty daies; but of the third joints of the rest in forty daies: Wherefore the joints of the fingers are soddered together in fourteen daies; and therefore in the dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of such joints, from the seventh or ninth day, untill the fourteenth day, we ought not at any time to untie the bands in the rest; we must wait for the time of healing, unless itching or small ulcers, or some humour collected between the head of the joint and the cavity, do shew that we must unbind loose ligatures, which must be repeated every third day. After this manner we must proceed untill the part seem to be strong enough, at which time the ligature must be untied; and the part that was disloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, must be fomented with a decoction that may strengthen it.

Wherefore in this case we must forbear to reduce the dislocation,

Fig. II and III. premising universals, and things preternatural being well disposed; and the belly being kept loose with glysters, we must lay on the part affected fat wool, and we must continually pour on hot water and oil, wherein there is plenty of hot water, and plenty of oil of Roses. For hot water will discuss the humours, will loosen the parts, and will ease the pain; oil of Roses will mitigate the pain, and by repelling will hinder the increasing of inflammation. Also the pain will be eased with new shorn greasie wool; and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is hindred. But because, when inflammation ceaseth, the humours collected are somewhat thickned; therefore, about the end of the inflammation, we must chafe the part gently with our hands, first anointed with oil of sweet Almonds, or with common oil; and then we must lay on the Cataplasm of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or <hi>Nileus,</hi> which <hi>Galen</hi> describes <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de comp. med. sec. loc. cap.</hi> 5. and these are the best when the inflammation declines, by reason of the wax, Ammoniacum, Oil, Saffran and Vineger; than which there is nothing better to soften, call forth, and to discuss.

After this let the part be bound somewhat looser, and with fewer swathes, wet with water and oil. This must be done every day, untill such time as the inflammation declines, which happens for the most part on the fifth day. When the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation declines, we must apply the aforesaid Cataplasms, or <hi>Oxycroceum Nicolai,</hi> to resolve the remainder of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, with a Ligature yet more loose.

But some men fear these kind of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in great joints only (namely the Wrist, Arm, Shoulder, Ankle, Knee and Thigh) which by reason of the strong Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and the greatness of the ligaments and vessels hinder Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; unless the Patient and the standers by, having heard of the great danger, do press to have it done, which the Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an must attempt either the first, second, eighth or ninth day, that he may not appear to be ignorant in Chirurgery, but not in smaller joints, as the fingers, toes and extremities of the hand; which <hi>Celsus</hi> reduceth likewise foretelling the danger, first looking to the inflammation and convulsion, then to the wound and dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Where therefore a greater joint cannot be reduced, first care must be taken for universals and diet, and the part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all extension or binding must be placed in a mean figure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hanged from the neck, or else gently laied down in a Capsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, that it may remain immovable and feel no pain. Also inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and convulsion that are at hand must be hindred, with some medicament that easeth pain, concocts, cools and repels. Such a Medicament according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 4. <hi>de Artic.</hi> 6. is a cerat with pitch, which is extended upon a plaister that was wet with sharp black wine and warm; first pressed out, and laid warm to the joint.</p>

                  <head>The Cure of a dislocation with a callous, which hinders the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and motion of the joint.</head>
                  <p>IN joints that before or after the reduction are ill handled, a callous easily grows; especially in those that are not compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about with much flesh, as the elbow, knee and foot; other joints sometimes, but not so easily, are troubled with a callous, because they are more fleshy, and they easily discuss the sanguine humour, which falls down for the nourishment, and more facile motion of the joints. Now the callous is either hard, or as hard as a stone, or else not so hard and stony. There are four marks of a stony callous. 1. The joint is seen to be most slender and most dry. 2. The Patient cannot move the joint, nor yet the forcible hand of the Chyrurgian. 3. The slenderness and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the part is continual. 4. There were applied medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were too cold, very astringent and drying, whereby the aforesaid humour was turned into a stony matter. Also there are four marks of a callous simply hard: 1. If the disease be new, for when it grows old, it becomes like a stone. 2. Though the Patient cannot move the part, yet the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian can. 3. If fit remedies were applied to the joint. 4. There will be some tumour in the part which is hard, but not so hard as a bone.</p>
                  <p>The stony callous will not be cured by <hi>Celsus</hi> his way without danger, wherefore it must be left as it is. But the cure of a soft callous, or not so hard, is this: First, Empty the body by purging and bleeding. 2. Let there be ordred a good rule for diet, and other not natural things. 3. Let the part be softned with oil, or with this medicament following:

                  <p>Boil all these in a sufficient quantity of pure water, untill the flesh of the head part from the bones; and with the steem of this, let the joint, with a callous, be fomented for some daies; after fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, let the part be chafed for a third part of an hour long, the hands being first anointed with oil of sweet almonds and fresh goose-grease mingled together.

After three or four daies, for the softning and discussing of the callous, the fume of vineger is commended: Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> takes a Fire stone (or for want of this, a Mill-stone) which he makes red hot in the fire; afterwards he pours vineger upon it, wherein some piece of gum Ammoniac is steeped, that the steem rising from it, and received for a third part of an hour, may not only attenuate the callous, but also soften it: Attenuation being made, a Cataplasm must be laid on; either this that follows, or one that is stronger.

                  <p>A Joint slips out for three reasons. 1. When, after a violent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location, the joint is ill set, and the ligaments are not wel dried. 2. When some tumour that arises from inflammation, and is ill cured, hinders it, that the joint cannot be contained in its place. 3. When a humour runs to the joint which relaxes the Ligaments. The first cause requires greater driers: The second shews emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and discutients, of which I speak before: The third is worst of all; which (after that the body is purged by medicaments, a vein opened, and a good diet used) requires adustion, than which there is nothing better. For this cauterizing first consumes all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154387:52"/> those moistures by a hard crust, which makes a hollow ulcer, which being covered with a cicatrize, contracts the part relaxed; for by cauterizing we heat, dry and digest the humours. But we must note: 1. To burn the place to which the bone falls; as if the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fall under the arm-pit, the burning must be made under the arm-pit. If the head of the thigh be out of joint to the fore-part, the fore parts must be burned in many places. 2. The nervous parts, ligaments, veins, arteries and glandulous parts must not be burned, for fire is an enemy to them; for by reason of their driness a wonderfull convulsion follows. 3. The burning must be made with iron tools, which make no great Escars; wherefore small iron instruments must be chosen like to Olives, with sharp points, and well fired red hot. 4. That after this burning the joint may rest for many daies, for if it should slip out again, the disease were incurable.</p>

                  <head>The Cure of a simple fracture.</head>
                  <p>A Fracture overthwart or obliquely, is cured in four things. First, By reduction. 2. By preserving the part reduced. 3. By the ingendring of a callous. 4. By correcting the accidents that come upon fractures. Reduction is performed by two things; namely, Extension and Conformation, either by force, or by fitting the parts together.</p>
                  <p>Also in Extension we must consider: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. where. 2. when, 3. the manner. 4. the instruments. 5. the quality. 6. the quantity.</p>
                  <p>Where there needs Extension; namely, when the parts of the broken bone do not yet lie right, but one lies over another.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:154387:52"/>
                  <p>The Time is best, if we extend presently, so soon as we know the fracture; for if that be not done, there is presently a great flux of humours, by reason of the vehement pain, and the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are drawn toward their beginnings, and so extension becomes difficult; and if we go about it, the broken bones do prick the fleshy parts that lie near unto them, and inflammations, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and other evil accidents follow. Yet extension may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e inflammation come; namely, on the second or third day; on the fourth day and the daies following (until such time as fear of inflammation be over) <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbids to make extension. But the latter Chyrurgians, that they may lessen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ease the pain, and may soften the muscles that are contracted toward their beginnings, do moisten the broken part with hot water: Others take oil and water, or the decoction of Mallows, Marsh mallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with the vapour of these they do foment the part, for a whole hour together. Where you must note that at the beginning of this fomenting, the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted will swell extreamly; but when you have fomented a while; not only the tumour raised by the steem, but also that which was before which hindred the extension, will vanish also. Also the skin of a Calf, newly killed, is an excellent remedy; or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures skin bound about it whilest it is yet hot, and kept for some hours about the part broken, for it hath a notable digesting force; softning and easing pain.</p>
                  <p>The Manner. The broken part is kept in a mean figure, with instruments necessary for extension both below and above the fracture, and it is drawn most rightly both waies; namely, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downward.</p>
                  <p>The Instruments, sometimes are only the hands of two Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that are strong, where the attraction is gentle, Table XXIX. Figure I. Sometimes strings of linnen or leather, where we must draw harder, Table XXIV. Figure I. And sometimes Engines, where we must extend with the greatest force, Table XXV. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure I.</p>
                  <p>The Quallty varieth according to the magnitude of the bones and muscles. Whence it is that the radius requires the least exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the bones require greater which are in the top of the hands and feet: Yet greater the arm and the <hi>Fibula:</hi> The shoulder and the leg require greater than they; and the thigh bone the greatest of all.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:154387:53"/>
                  <p>Moreover in every bone a stronger extension is indured. 1. In a soft body rather than a hard body. 2. The first day rather than the daies following, when the fear of inflammation remains. 3. An old fracture than a new.</p>
                  <p>The Quantity; the part is extended right forth, untill such time as the bones are placed right one against another, and do not touch one the other.</p>
                  <p>Conformation will be made well; if, whilest the instruments that extend, are slackned by little and little, and the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an posture, the parts of the broken bone, which do not yet lie right one against another, are set exactly right, and the prominent parts of them are hid in their proper cavities, by the hands of the Chyrurgian, sweetly and gently without any violence at all. Table XXVI. Fig. I This operation succeeds excellently well, when the member made conformable, is like to the sound member in figure, and we can feel no inequality by handling of it, and the vehement pain is ended or abated.</p>
                  <p>Conservation of the fracture now reduced, consists in binding and hindring of inflammation, by topical means; binding is made with Bands, Splents and Ferulaes.</p>
                  <p>Bands, Tab. XXIX. E F G, are provided of old linnen rags, and such as are worn with using, that they may be the more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet they must be strong, lest being extended they should tear; they must have no seams or knots, that they may bind equally and without pain. But the breadth of the bands is known by the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the part: for the thicker part requires a broader band, and the thinner those that are narrower.</p>
                  <p>The length must be as much as is needfull; namely, that the binding may comprehend a great part of the sound part, both above and beneath the fracture, made with requisite circumvolutions, which must be as many as are requisite to strengthen the broken part.</p>
                  <p>Splents, Table XXIX. Letter I. are linnen cloaths (the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made them of hards kembed out) often folded together; and they are called Splents, because they are like the Spleens of brute beasts, which use to be long and narrow; others call these cloaths Plagets: The Ancients called them <hi>Plumaceolos</hi> or <hi>Pulvillos,</hi> small feather bolsters or cushions, because they made them of feathers sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between two linnen cloaths. These splents must be so long, that they comprehend all the ligature; for if they should be shorter, they would not defend all the circumvolutions of the ligature: But
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154387:53"/> the breadth of them must be the breadth of three or four fingers os the Patient. As for their thickness, they must be three, and also sometimes four double, where there is need of more strengthningf And when they must compass the whole part about, so many must be taken as can go round about the part. Whence <hi>Hippocrates lib. de offic. medic. Let the length of the Splents, breadth, thickness and multitude be thus. For l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He also counsels to make choice of such Ferulaes which are flat upwards at the ends; for those that have alwaies the same thickness even to the end, and are equally bound on that part, are better than all others are: But this is not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient at all to be done, when he will that the Ferulaes shall bind faster in the middle of the Ligature; and from thence, unto both ends; they should be more loose, and at the ends loosest of all. He will also that they shall be shorter, for length, than the binding is, that they may not touch the skin beyond the Ligature; which, because it receives ofttimes the humours pressed out by the bands, becomes more swoln. Also he will have the Ferulaes to be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I, with happy success, alwaies use a Medicament which is compounded of sharp Wine, oil of Roses, and the whites of Eggs beaten together with a spatula, when they are mingled in due proportion: If pain be urgent, I leave out the whites of Eggs, and I mingle Oil with the Wine in greater quantity.

Then we must take another swathe band, that is longer than the former, that it may come to that place where the first band ended; and one or two circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must be made (the contrary way; for if the former were toward the right hand, this must be toward the left hand) upon the fracture; and from thence toward the lower part, the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding must be brought; diminishing likewise the compression, by degrees, as we did before, But the circumvolutions of this swathe must not be so many, because we do not here fear the extream parts so much; and when we have taken in sufficient of the sound part, we must then leave off to make any more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions toward the lower part. Table XXIX. Figure II. the bands return by the fracture, with more seldom circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, untill they come so far as the end of the first band. But because these two bands, now roled about, are too weak to hold the fracture, Splents must be applied about the fracture, and the whole part; namely, according to the length of it, to be laid on long waies; not that one shall be put upon another, but that betwixt one Splent and another, there be so much distance as a fingers breadth of the Patient himself; these must be made fast with a third ligature from a double end, so that the first circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution must be made upon the fracture; then the other end must be brought toward the upper parts, with more frequent circumvolutions; and the other end toward the lower parts, and the circumvolutions must not be so many; then again from the lower parts upward, untill we come to that place where the other end of this swathe came to an end. Yet both ends must be so often roled about, that the ends of the Plagets may stick forth a little at each end. Table XXIX. Fig. III. It shall be the sign of convenient ligature, when the Patient reports that it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154387:55"/> is bound firmly; but not pressed, and more upon the part hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After convenient Ligature, there succeeds good Deposition; which is the middle figure, soft, equal and tending upwards. Wherefore let the part that is bound, be laid in a wooden Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula that is filled up, being wrapt in kembed hards and linnen, and so let it remain untill the third day; if the Patient that day he is bound, and the night following, seems to himself to be bound more streight, and on the second day less; besides this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If on the third day, after binding the part, the bands seem to be too loose, they must be unbound again (but we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that when we must unbind the Ligature, before the bones be at all knit, the windings about of the bands, are not to be unbound by little and little, but the part must lie still, and the linnen and bands must be cut, untill such time as the upper part being uncovered, you may take all things away, the part not being l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The bands must be bound every fifth day after this, and the part being sprinkled with hot water, must be dressed with a Cerat, Bands and Ferulaes, looser than before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such time as the fracture may be confirmed with a moderate callous; which is wont to be done in bones of the Arm, for the most part, in thirty daies; in the bones of the shoulder and leg, in about forty daies; and for the thigh, in about fifty daies:

                  <p>Excoriation which often arises, when the unloosing of the bands is deferred longer than it ought to be; and again when the Patients are impatient and scratch, is cured by the pouring on warm water, as I said for the cure of itching; and by applying unguent <hi>de Cerussa,</hi> which cools and dries.</p>
                  <p>Pain is mitigated by fomenting with Water and Oil, or with the decoction of a Wether's head with Camomile flowers.</p>
                  <p>The Callous is bred greater than it should, when the Patient uses a fuller diet than he ought to do, or the Physitian is more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the cure; if he do not feel his Pulse, and if he bind the bands too loose. This is prevented if you take away from his diet, and the quality of the callous be sometimes tried, and the bands bound somewhat streighter. It is diminished, first with emollient Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154387:56"/> and next, with emollient and discutient mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (such as were propounded for the cure of a dislocation with a Callous) untill it come to a mediocrity. A Callous that is too small, hath contrary causes, and therefore it is to be preserved by contraries. It is augmented with a more thickning diet, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the aliment to the part affected, by pouring on hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (yet with that moderation, that whilest the part is yet lifted up, we do desist before it fall down again) and by the more loose ligature of the bands.</p>
                  <p>Extenuation of the part proceeds, either from the too hard binding of the bands, or for want of glutinous nourishment. If binding cause Extenuation, the bands must be bound looser: If want of nourishment be the cause of smallness, let nutriment be attracted by fomenting with hot water, untill the part wax red; and then lay on some Pitch plaister upon it, spread upon a broad linnen cloath; and let it be oftentimes duly drawn off, taking heed afterwards that we bind not the bands too hard, which might again repulse the nutriment drawn thither.</p>
                  <p>Distorsion, or ill conformation of the part, proceeds either from the neglect of the Chyrurgian, when he makes less extension, joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hippocrates de fract.</hi> which <hi>Celsus</hi> seems to confirm, <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. where he writes of the cure of the legs and thighs. For we must not be ignorant that if the thigh be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that it will be made shorter, because it never returns to its former state: And <hi>Avicenna Lib.</hi> 4 <hi>Fen.</hi> 5. saith that it is a rare thing for the thigh once broken, to be perfectly cured again. These words admonish us, that we should never promise a perfect cure of the thigh; but rather, using all diligence, we should fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that it is doubtfull that the Patient will be alwaies lame; lest when this shall happen from the nature of the fracture, or which most frequently falls out, from the impatience of the sick person, it may be imputed to our mistake; and instead of a reward, bring us a disgrace. Also ill conformation may come by reason of the fracture, when a peece of the bone is contained between both the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154387:57"/> bones that are broken, which may hinder them to touch one the other. The bones that are disloca ed, either by the Physitians or the Patients fault, must not be broken again (unless it cannot be helped, by reason of the great hurt done to the part in its operations) if the Patient be old and weak, the Callous be of long standing and hardned, and the bone be great, as are the shoulder and thigh bones.

If any piece of the bone wrest aside the whole part, there must be incision made with a sharp knife, Table II Fig. II. as far as the broken bone; and the splint of the broken bone, which hinders the joining together, must be pulled out with the Pullers; and then the fracture must be fitted by extension, bound and laid down, as we deal with a new fracture.

                  <p>IN a Shingle Fracture, or that which is made according to the length of the bone, the bands must be bound streighter than in other fractures; that the bones broken, which are departed broad waies one from the other, may be brought again to a mutual and close touching one of the other, that they may not fall back again. <hi>Galen.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154387:57"/> with a wound, must be cured. There are divers kinds of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures with wounds; for either the bone is made naked of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riostium</hi> and the flesh; or else it is yet covered with them; in both again we expect that some great part, or small, or no part of the bone shall come forth.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>A Fracture with a simple wound.</head>
                  <p>IN which, neither the bone is made naked of its coverings, nor any part of the bone is come away: it is cured as a fracture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wound; namely 1. With convenient Extension, 2. With due joining together, and this is followed by a mutual touching together of the lips of the wound; and by keeping them so, when they are thus brought together, by linnen cloaths that are Plaisters laid cross waies upon them, and by bands. 3. By Deligation. 4. By Deposition.</p>
                  <p>Yet here about the cure we must note: 1. That Extension be presently made, by a Chyrurgian, on the first, or at furthest on the second day; namely, before any great inflammation falls upon the part. If the Chyrurgian be not called seasonably; but on the third, fourth or fifth day, in which the inflammation is near at hand, or else is begun, then extension must not be attempted until seven or a few more daies be over; and in the mean while, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian shall use all the force he hath to prevent inflammation; both by removing the antecedent cause, by diet, and Chyrurgery, and Physick; as by taking heed to the part affected by Anodyns, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, and convenient Deposition of the part as much as may be; and by covering the wound with such things as shall cause suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When the danger of inflammation is past, the fracture must be set either by Extension alone, or else by help of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor also; then it must be bound with three bands, and a sufficient number of plagets, and so laied down easily.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Extension must not be so violent, as in a simple fracture, because the fleshy, musculous and nervous substance, is already torn, bruised and hurt; for if we do otherwise, extream pains and convulsions will follow, with the greatest danger of the Patient's life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The first band must be something broader than the wound it self; espe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ially at the beginning, from whence we begin to wind it about, that it may comprehend the lips of the wound on both sides. For if the band be too narrow, then it would hold the ulcer bound in, and would cause pain.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:154387:58"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, The bands also must be bound less close than for a fracture without a wound; lest the wound being pressed, pain and inflammation should arise; and for the same reason, let them also be more soft than for a simple fracture. Let the part be untied the third day after extension and direction, and be bound again, yet so that the ligature may press it somewhat more (to make the part more slender) so long as the fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation remains, unless pain perswade to do otherwise. But in the second binding let not the ligature be made streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rather looser, that there may be passage left for the blood to come forth, which must be the matter of the callous.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Ferulaes must not be laid to the wound; and if they must be laid on, they must be placed on the sides of the wound, and the opposite part, untill such time as the wound is cured. But it seldom falls out, that a simple wound in such a fracture is not covered with a cicatrize, at the second or third dressing, or at least not filled up with flesh. When the wound is healed, if the bone be not yet strengthned, we must do as we did for a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fracture. But if in the mean time, namely on the eighteenth or twentieth day, or upon any other day, the wound grows worse, and the fracture of the bone threatens an impostumation (for the separation of the bone cannot at first be foreseen alwaies, unless the fracture wants its conformation, or the bone lieth a long time uncovered) <hi>(which is shewed by much atter, which is not proportionable to the greatness of the wound, by the lips of the wound turned inwards, and by the dull flesh bred in the wound)</hi> we must consider whether the piece of the bone be great or small? If it be great, the signs propounded are greater; if small, they are smaller. 2. Whether that piece which must part from the bone be yet parted, or remain upon it still? That is known, when the Patient, minding of it, finds a secret motion; or not minding of it, perceives a pricking pain: This, when the Patient finds neither secret, nor yet open motion.</p>

                  <head>A Fracture with a wound, in which the bone is not made na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet a great piece of the bone, or many pieces (as in wounds made with gun-shot) are known that they will come off presently, or else afterwards.</head>
                  <p>IF they will come off presently, this requires a ligature that is of another fashion, and far different from the former, according to the most sudden separation of the bone, that the part may be daily bound and unbound, without any moving of the fracture. The most approved way of binding, is that of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the matter is not stopt in, the fracture is strengthned, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is hindred, pain is not caused, and the most speedy sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the bone is procured. To perform all these things, let double Plagets be provided, made of linnen cloath, not narrower than that they may sufficiently cover the lips of the wound; as for length, let them be somewhat longer then to go once about the part; and let them be as many in number, as shall suffice to make a hatching ligature. Table XXVII. Figure VIII. These must be wet with a mixture of sharp wine, and oil of Roses, to ease pain, and to hinder inflammation; they are laid upon a broader linnen cloath, in that order that the middle Plaget may cover the next to it, and these the middle of those that are further off. These things being provided, and the fracture being joined, and a suppurative medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being laid to the wound; namely, <hi>Galen's Tetrapharmacum,</hi> that linnen cloath with the Plagets so disposed, must be laid under the part to be bound, so that the middle Plaget must come under the fracture, Table XXVIII. Figure VIII. Then the Assistant shall hold one end of the middle Plaget streight, and the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian shall hold another, which must be so brought about, that far from the ends they may cut one another circularly, and may bind the part that is hurt closely, as far as it is lawfull, rather than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, for fractures with a wound, and where a piece of the bone is to come away. The middle Plaget being brought into a circle, let also the first of the upper Plagets be brought about, then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then the third, and so forward untill we come unto that part, to which the first band, Table XXIX. Figure I. should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend if there were no wound. These upper Plagets being fitted, we must likewise order the first of the lowermost, then the second, then the third, then the fourth, and so forward descending as far as the sound part, Table XXIX. Figure II. These medicaments
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154387:59"/> with their Ligature must be applied (daily wetting the bands only with wine and oil) untill such time as the term of the inflammation be over; then by all means we must strive that the bone which is coming off, may be thrust out so soon as possibly it may be, helping n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ure by an injection of <hi>decoctum divinum,</hi> and laying on <hi>ceratum sacrum</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> upon the wound (that it may only comprehend the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ps of it) and a <hi>Diapalma</hi> about the affected par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Note, lay on the plaister <hi>Diapalma</hi> with seven single Splints (be they more or fewer) and let their ends be brought round about, beginning at the middle one, and afterwards ascending and descending, as we use to do, with double Plagets. The Splints with the cerat being laied on, lay on the Plagets made of double linnen cloath, and wet in sour wine, that they may stick the faster together.</p>
                  <p>The bone being thrust out into fight, and it being drawn forth with the Pullers, if it can be done without violence, the wound must be healed with <hi>ceratum divinum.</hi> But when the wound is brought to cicatrize, the part must be kept in rest, untill the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may grow strong, Ferulaes being laied round about it. Note farther, that if it be needfull to remove the bands, either for their foulness or hardness, the part must be lifted up; but it must be presently laied down again upon a broader cloath of linnen; upon which those small linnen cloaths doubled were already laid. Table XXIX, Figure VIII.</p>
                  <p>If the bone appear that it will not presently part, but will come away afterwards, the Ligature (which is made with three Bands and Splents) must be changed into a hatching Ligature, described even now, untill the bone do separate. The bone that is great enough (such as are those printed Table XXVII. Figure IV. and Table XXIX. Figure IX.) being parted, the circular dressing, with the plaisters (Table XXVIII. Figure VIII. in the leg) must be changed into a cross form (Table XXVII Figure I) and the Ligature must begin from the lowest Plaget, and must end in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost (Table XXVIII. Figure X.) that the moisture, collected in the cavity of the bone separated, may be pressed out of the wound (which being thrust down, by the Plagets descending, would make a large hollow pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e) when the wound is brought to cicatrize, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulaes may be laid on to confirm the fracture.</p>

                  <head>A Fracture with a wound, wherein the bone is made naked of the <hi>Periostium,</hi> yet it doth not stick without the wound.</head>
                  <p>THis is cured: First, By moderate extension of the part. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By convenient joining together. Thirdly, By fitting the lips of the wound to touch one the other. Fourthly, By fit Ligature, Fifthly, By fitting deposition. In binding we must consider, whether any part of the bone will come off or not? None will come off, if the bone that was made naked, be presently covered with a skin again. Some will come off, if the naked bone be long exposed to the open air. If none, or but a small bone, will come off, the binding must be made with three bands and plaisters, as in a fracture with a simple wound, and wherein there is expected a separation of some small bone. If a great bone be to come off, the part affected must be bound with a hatching Ligature; as I said, even now, for a fracture where a great bone was to come away.</p>

                  <head>A Fracture with a wound, where the bone sticks out of the wound.</head>
                  <p>BEfore it be reduced, we must consider whether the bone, stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth, can be brought again to its own place, by help of due extension or not, without violence and danger of convulsion? And if it can be reduced without danger, let it be reduced; but if not, let it not be reduced. The signs of dangerous reduction are, great sticking forth, inflammation, and the part grown hard by contraction of the muscles: But easie reduction appears by a small bone sticking forth, when there is no inflamed tumour, and the part is soft. If therefore it cannot be reduced, of two evils the least is to be chosen; the naked bone sticking forth (with predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the shortness of the part that will be afterwards, lest that should be laid upon the Chyrurgian as his fault) must be nipped off with a pair of Plncers, Table XX. Figure I. and afterwards the fracture must be joined by moderate extending of the part. For it is better to make the part something shorter, than to leave the bones not join'd together, or to extend them violently; both of which would bring convulsion and death to the sick Patient. If the bone diminished cannot yet be set, by the moderate extension of the hand; that extension must be helped, according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> with a levitor or some cutting chizel, put in between the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154387:60"/> broken bones, Table XXVII. Figure IX. The fracture being composed, the part must be bound as we said for a fracture with a simple wound. But we must cut a hole in the bands and plaisters just over the wound, that we may daily lay on medicaments upon a great wound. The reason why the bands must be made with this hole, is this, because a great wound, and therefore to be cured by the second intention, breeds plenty of Atter, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires often looking to; but the bone that is diminished, for fear of a new contraction of the muscles, forbids us to lift up the part often, or to unbind the bands; wherefore we must take the middle way, that we may satisfie both the fracture and the wound.</p>
                  <p>I have cured very many with this way of binding; amongst the chief of them, there is a young man yet living, who about the twentieth year of his age, fell from a high place in the night, and broke both the fostils of his leg in the middle, with a great sticking forth of the minor fostil; which unless I had cut it off with a pair of pincers, Table XX. Fig. I. I could not possibly have joined the broken bones. This Patient, in four moneths time, began to walk with a staff; and he went afterwards as if he had never broken his leg, or had lost no part of the bone; which must be well observed, for it seldom happens that the Patient, with a double fracture, with a wound and loss of the bone, should not halt after he is cured. This kind of Ligature, though it require great diligence of the Chyrurgian, yet oftentimes the Patients cured shew themselves ungratefull: Wherefore it must not alwaies be charged upon the Physitians, that they are Mountebanks, who sometimes begin their cure as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> dictates, from taking a reward, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that first,
<q>
                        <l>Whilest the pain lasts, that when the sick man's well,</l>
                        <l>What he paid for it he may others tell.</l>
                     </q> when a small bone sticking forth can be reduced, without danger of convulsion and violence: first the part must be extended mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately: then the fracture must be composed; And if the bones can hardly be united by extension only, for fear of great pain and more dangerous convulsion, let not so strong extension be made; but let there be put, between the parts extended of the divided bone, the broader and the narrower end of a Levitor, that it, lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that part of the bone which is most pressed down, and leaning upon that part which is most prominent, may help the extension, untill such time as the bones shall seem to be placed one right
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154387:60"/> against the other; then, by degrees, let loose the extension, and draw forth the Levitor.</p>
                  <p>If perhaps the bone, upon which there leans a convenient Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitor, hath in the upper part many broken splints, or something that is sharp, that there is no convenient place for the Levitor, they must be taken off with a sharp chizel, Table VI. Figure III. but this with the pincers, Table XX. Figure I. must be nipped off, that there may be a fit place made for the Levitor. When the bone is reduced; we must consider whether any part of the bone will come away or not? If it be reduced presently, nothing will come off; but if it be not set presently, something may come off. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be to come off, the part affected must be bound (first laying a suppurative Medicament to the wound) as I said of a fractuce with a simple wound. But if something be looked for to come off, we must order our Ligature, according to the manner appointed for a fracture with separation of a great bone.</p>

And it is turned about, not only that there may be passage for the matter to come forth by the pores of the bone; but also that the <hi>Pericranium</hi> may feel no inflammation; which it will easily do, if the instrument be not turned about.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. is a band with four ends; whose two ends before <hi>(h. i.)</hi> are knit under the chin; but the hinder ends <hi>(k. l,)</hi> are to be sewed behind the head with a thread; lest the knot, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the sick lieth asleep on his back, might wake him by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that part; and watchings oftentimes are the cause of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the <hi>Peticranium,</hi> which proves to be mortal.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. here you see a convenient use and binding of the band, to hold on the medicaments which are applied to the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanel, burnt in where the futures meet. But to what end serves that great furniture of the first Figure, if two instruments only be sufficient for this operation? This serves to deceive the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; I cause a low seat with joints to be brought, such as Barbers use in their shops, turning the one side, either the right side or the left, toward the light and the windows, but the back toward the dore, and that for this reason; lest the sick sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in this Chair, should perceive the red hot iron, when it is brought out of the kitchin. The Patient being rightly set down, I draw forth, into a wooden dish set upon the Table, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>(c. d. e.)</hi> but I keep the iron tool <hi>(a)</hi> close in my bag. The servant secretly delivers the instrument <hi>(b)</hi> to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's maid; and gives her order to make it very red hot, and not to bring it, untill she be commanded to bring some live coles. These things being done, the servant doth shave away
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154387:63"/> so much hair of the head as is needfull, Figure IV. but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the band, Figure VI. and a double linnen cloath (<hi>f</hi> Fig. I.) and other things necessary to be used after the operation; in the mean while I discourse with the Patient, concerning the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this Chyrurgical operation (and if he be desirous to learn it, as it often falls out) I speak of the qualities of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and of other things which may keep up his mind from fearing the fire. These things being provided, I speak to my servant openly, that he should hold his temples firm, with both his hands (see Table XXXI. Fig. II.) that I, standing behind the Patient's back, may find the joining of the sutures with the threads (Figure III.) and having found it (Fig. IV.) I may mark it with ink. Whilest the place is marked, I call the maid to bring the fire-pan, and set it on the Table; and that she shall only moderately warm one of the iron instruments <hi>(c. d. e.)</hi> and I secretly receive from the maid, passing by me and coming to the Table, the iron instrument <hi>(b)</hi> very red hot; and so the Patient scarce taking notice of it (for he beleeves that the iron instrument, necessary to burn with, is not yet hot) I make a fontanel in the coronal suture. This way of deceit must be observed also, in making other fontanels, to hide the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and to take off the fear of the fire.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. is the furniture to dilate the wounds of the head, and to pare away the chinks, which do not pass through both Tables.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. in wounds of the head, with the skull hurt, first of all the hair must be shaved off, and the head must be moistned with oil of Roses. Yet with this caution, that neither the hair nor the oil go into the wound; for that is ill for any wounds of the head. Then let the wound be dilated in the form of a cross, unless the sutures hinder it: The next day after that it is dilated, let the place for the instrument be made black with writing ink.</p>
               <p>Fig. X. The third day after incision, let the blackness made with ink be pared away with paring instruments. Note, that in shaving about the wound, the lips of the wound must be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with linnen cloaths to defend them; as when you set on the Trepan, Table XXXI. Fig. V.</p>
               <p>Fig. XI. shews the small chink, in the middle of the place shaved away, which must yet be taken off with paring tools.

                  </gap>G. I. is the furniture or instruments necessary to dilate the wounds of the head, and to perforate the broken skul.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. shews the dilating of the wound triangularly with a knife. Fig. I. <hi>(a) for here the coronal future hinders to cut it cross-waies, and so doth the temporal muscle: the section begins from the forehead, for if it be made otherwise the fibraes of the temporal muscle would be cut overthwart.</hi> The triangle is sought on the right side of the fissure of the skul, whereby the Trepan, which the coronal suture, on the left side, would not suffer to be set on, may be used: the head is held with mens hands, and is bolstred up with a pillow that it may stand firm.</p>
               <p>Fig. III. the wound is seen dilated triangularly, and the skul is uncovered with a narrow chink in it; by which the matter, which descends to the membranes, cannot be voided forth. Wherefore at the side of the chink, noted with a star, the skul must be opened with a Trepan, to let the matter out.</p>
               <p>He that goes about to Trepan the skul; must come to the Patient with the instruments printed Fig. I. of this Table; namely, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a small piercer; a male Trepan <hi>(b)</hi> and two females <hi>(c d)</hi> Probes <hi>(e f)</hi> a Puller <hi>(h)</hi> and a Lenticular instrument with a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitor <hi>(i:)</hi> then he must prepare those things that are laid in the dish, Fig. IV; and the band Fig. X.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. shews a glass full of Rose-water, wherein the linnen cloaths are moistned, which must be laid to the lips of the wounds: <hi>(b)</hi> is a little piece of red silk, wet in oil of Roses; hanged by a thread <hi>(c)</hi> the little ball <hi>(d)</hi> of dry linnen rags, to cover the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154387:65"/> hole that must be made with the Trepan, that the matter of the wound may not descend to the membranes of the brain; <hi>(e e e)</hi> shew the little balls that must be applied to the naked skull; for dry things are proper for dry things: also <hi>(f f)</hi> shew the little balls besmeared with a digestive <hi>(g)</hi> to digest the lips of the wound; the simple linament spread upon a linnen cloath <hi>(h;)</hi> and a linnen cloath three or four double <hi>(i;)</hi> the little bone <hi>(k)</hi> is thrust with the iron pin <hi>(l)</hi> out of the female Trepan.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. things to be provided being provided; the head being supported, and the lips defended with linnen cloaths, the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian shall set on the Trepan with a pin, and marked with a star, Figure III. wherewith he shall begin to Trepan the skul; which he must end with females. Here <hi>Porralius</hi> admonisheth young Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians, since according to <hi>Hippocrates Aph.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. experience is dangerous, that they should often exercise themselves in Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panning the skuls of dead men; putting under the skul a piece of white paper, to represent the <hi>dura mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fig. VI. shews the skull cut out with Trepans, at the side of the chink.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. the brims of the hole are made even with a Lenticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knife.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. shews a small linnen rag, wet with oil, how it is let down upon the membrane; being fastned with a thread that it may be drawn forth again; when that is drawn out, one that is fresh must constantly supply the place of it.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. is the band called Cancer, which for wounds of the head is the best of all to contain them, and also the most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; broad in the middle (A) and on both sides having four ends; whereof two begin from the temples, and end in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the head, where they must be sewed (D;) two arise from the hinder part of the head, and are bound together on the fore part of the head (B;) two are turned behind the ears (C,) and as many before them (E) and are fastned under the chin together.</p>
               <p>Fig. X. is the head bound about with the band called Cancer. 1. The ends D are united behind the head. 2. C under the chin. 3. D on the fore-part, above the fore-head. 4. E under the chin. Yet let the head be bound delicately, so that the band may hold fast, but not press it.</p>

The latter way of curing seems to be safer than the former, because the skin being cut quite through, it is almost impossible but that the <hi>Pericranium</hi> must be hurt also.</p>

                  <head>Of a wound of the head, with hurt done to the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> with alteration of the skul, and the seat of the instrument.</head>
                  <p>OTher wounds with hurt done to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> or the seat of the instrument, must be cured by ingendring of flesh. They cannot safely be sewed, nor yet glewed together, for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which <hi>Hier.

When therefore, the first hour one is hurt, the Chyrurgian is called, to one wounded only by incision of the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> he shall presently dilate the wound with little balls made of hemp hards, and wet in whites of Eggs beaten together, that so the flux of blood may be stopped, and also the lips of the wound may be kept asunder: also let him anoint the parts, that are next, with astringent oils made hot, to prevent inflammation; and let him apply convenient ligature, that which is called Cancer (Table XXXI. Fig. IX, X.) with a three double linnen cloath, that the parts hurt, be not more hurt by the ambient air, which is an enemy to wounds of the head; or that the medicaments laid on upon the wound may not fall off: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the band note here, that the ends of it D, to be fastned behind the head, must be sewed; because otherwise the not will do much harm, and make pain with watching.</p>

                  <p>The second day after the hurt done, let the Chyrurgian take off the hards, and all other things that are accidental; and the blood being stopt, and the hair shaved away round about, he shal dress the wound with lint made up into little pellets, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a digestive medicament; applying upon it <hi>Emplastrum Diapalma</hi> with a hole cut in it with a pair of ciz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>When that appears, to cleanse the wound, he must daily min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle some detergent medicament with the digestive, untill it be throughly well mundified, continuing the use of the three dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloath, and of the band with unctions, When the wound is cleansed from filth, he must labour to ingender flesh; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must lay upon the lips of it a sarcotick ointment spread upon dry lint; and not oil of Roses as some ignorant Barbers use to do; upon that he must lay only the Cerat <hi>Diapalma,</hi> then a three double cloath, wet in red wine, or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But if the bare bone be but only altered by the ambient air, (if it lie but open to it for two hours) or if it also grow black; (if it lie longer open to it) then we must scrape off all round about, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the colour be changed, or till blood comes forth of it. Namely, when the quitter appears to be good, and the wound to be cleansed. If the Chyrurgian observe this time, he shall find that the bone which was but once scraped, and cephatick powders strewed upon it, and dressed with dry lint, will be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with flesh the next day. For <hi>Iacob Berengarius Carpensis,</hi> is not to be heard, who, <hi>lib. de fractur. cran, cap.</hi> 42. commands that every day we should pare away, with a rasp, what is superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially altered of the bone; because that paring away, performed at the time spoken of, is sufficient; but if it be done before that time, it must be often repeated, and that not without danger of the Patient; for by this reason the paring instrument will, by degrees, come to the Diplois. They that are more fearfull, leave the bone altered to Natures scaling of it, but they prolong the cure.</p>
                  <p>The wound filled with flesh, must at last be covered with a

Frick</hi> a Fuller of <hi>Vlma,</hi> was wounded the very same year and day: <hi>Iohn Bucher</hi> a Country man of <hi>Achstet,</hi> who, near to the temporal muscle, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642, on the 13. day of <hi>March,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a wound on the <hi>Pericranium:</hi> And <hi>Erhardus Vilseker</hi> of <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> Steward of the Lord Governour <hi>N. Sals,</hi> who, <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. in <hi>Iune,</hi> had a wound on his head, was by me at length cured, where he was with the Provost Martial at <hi>Vlma, Matthaeus Stalzlinus</hi> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon me to assist me.</p>
                  <p>The seat of the instrument appearing, must be presently pared away with a knife, as soon as the wound is dilated: after that the wound dilated and the skul pared away with paring tools, must be dressed with convenient medicaments.</p>

                  <head>A wound of the head with the skul made bare, and a rift as small as a hair not penetrating.</head>
                  <p>IF that a prudent Chyrurgian be called to cure a short wound of the head, with the skul laid bare, he must presently shave away the hairs of the head, moistned with common oil; and he must most diligently search how the bone doth, either with a Probe or with his sight, or with both together; and if he find a fracture or a chink, or by the antecedent and present symptoms he have a suspicion of a fracture, or else doubt whether there be a fracture or not, he shall immediately dilate the wound, contrary to the common custom of Barbers, with a streight pen knife (Table II. Figure II.) cross waies (Table XXIX. Figure IX) or else after the form of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle (Table XXX. Figure II.) namely where the sutures and muscles, especially the temporal muscles, will not suffer us to make a cross; that the bone, being laid naked, may admit the necessary manual operations, by paring tools or Trepans, safely and without
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154387:68"/> any hurt to the sensible parts, But yet if paring or trepanning of the skul be needfull, and may be performed without any dilating of the wound by an iron instrument, then we shall totally abstain from section. The wound being artificially dilated, the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian shall forthwith part the lips of it, and the <hi>Pericranium</hi> also with it, with the nails of his fore finger and thumb of his right hand, from the substance of the skul, and shall lay dry lint upon the bone, and shall fill up the rest of the wound with balls made of hemp hards, wet in the white of Eggs, and strewed over with astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent powder; not only to stop the blood, but also that the wound may not fall in, and that the next day it may lie wide open with no labour; upon it let him lay <hi>linimentum simplex,</hi> spread upon a fine linnen cloath (that it may only comprehend the lips of the wound) and above this let him apply the Plaister or Cataplasm of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with a decent Ligature; namely, by that which is called the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; and by anointing the parts that are near vvith astringent oils, to prevent inflammation.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the hards being taken off, the blood being stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the wound being cleansed from all unnatural things, let there be, with a pen, writing ink drawn upon the chink, by the Chyrurgian; and let him dress the skul with dry lints but the lips of the wound being first anointed with some digestive, he must lay upon that <hi>linimentum simplex,</hi> and then <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plaister, and the Ligature called Cancer, together with the aforesaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing.</p>
                  <p>At the third visitation, the wound being bound, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ears, according to some mens advice, stopped with wool, and his head being well placed, and underpropt with a bolster, he shall scrape off the chink which hath drunk in the writing ink, or rather printers ink (which <hi>Iulius Caesar Arantius comm. in Hippoc. de vulneribus capitis,</hi> prefers before writing ink, by reason of the vitriol in it, which is biting) with rasping tools, Table XXX. Figure X. according to the length of it, beginning with the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger rasp; and by degrees proceeding to one that is less, and so to one less than that, untill such time as the chink be quite gone, and the bone under it appear white and sound; which is a most certain and demonstrative sign, that the chink pared away did not penetrate the skul, When the Chyrurgian useth this operation, he shall often take away the dust from the rasping instruments; and let him be carefull that he hurt not the skin or the <hi>Pericranium</hi> with them; which may be avoided, if the Patient's head lie firm
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154387:68"/> whilest he useth his operation, and the lips of the wound be all cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with small linnen rags, Table XXXI. Figure V. Others do oftentimes wet their rasping tools in oil of Roses, that they may run the easier. But because this anointing is wont to dull the edges of the rasps, I use to change them. When the bone is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and sufficiently pared, you must lay dry lint upon it (for when the skul is bare and pared, a digestive is not convenient, nor an unguent, nor any fat thing) and to the lips of the wound we must apply a digestive spread upon lint, and upon that <hi>linimentum simplex,</hi> the Cataplasm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the band called Cancer, with the usual anointing with oils that keep of defluxions.</p>
                  <p>When the quitter appears good, we must mingle some deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with the digestive, untill the wound grow perfectly clean; when the wound is cleansed, then we must strew cephatick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the pared bone, and we must apply dry lint to it; but to the lips <hi>unguentum sarcoticum,</hi> with the cerat <hi>Diapalma,</hi> with a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble linnen cloath wet in wine of the decoction of corroboratives, and pressed forth, and with a band, leaving out the oils. The wound being filled with flesh, must be brought to cicatrize by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Epuloticks. After this manner was <hi>Iohan. Rudolphus Straus</hi> of <hi>Kafenburg</hi> dressed and cured; and <hi>Caspar Wirth</hi> a Miller of the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital at <hi>Vlma,</hi> who both had a rift like a hair, that did not penetrate, near to the coronal suture.</p>

                  <head>A wound of the head, with a fracture of the skul no bigger than a hair, that doth penetrate.</head>
                  <p>BUt when the Chyrurgian works with these rasps, to try the wound, and he finds a chink which penetrates the second Table, he must not go about to take that away with his rasps (because with them the membranes, which cover the brain, may easily be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended) but laying aside all Chyrurgery, he shall proceed with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with which alone oftentimes the Patients are cured; nor is it to be feared, if we timely begin to pare away the skul, but that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may resolve the matter (which doubtless descends in a small quantity) to the <hi>dura mater;</hi> for after paring of the skul, the <hi>dura mater</hi> receives in nothing by the chink, which remains in the second Table; because the excrements of the wound, which are apt to run forth, are continually dried up by the dry lint.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:154387:69"/>
                  <p>Sometimes the bone pared and dressed with driers, will cast off a scale, that the way for the quitter, collected about the membrane, may be open enough for it to come out. I observed this separation in one <hi>George Stuzzel,</hi> who, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. had a small crack, like to a hair, on the right side of his fore-head, yet it penetrated through both Tables; after that the chink was scraped away as far as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Table, and a scale came off of it self; he was most happily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Hospital there.</p>
                  <p>But if great symptoms do accompany a crack in the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which shew that there is much matter collected between the <hi>dura mater</hi> and the skul; laying aside the Rasps, the skull must be presently bored through with the Trepan, according to the words of <hi>Hippocrates text.</hi> 2. <hi>de vulneribus capitis.</hi> When you have pared the bone with a rasp, if you find necessity to cut the skul open, you must cut it; and not suffer three daies to pass before you do cut it, but within that time you must do it.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>A wound of the head, with an evident yet narrow crack in the skul.</head>
                  <p>WHen we are certain that the crack goes through, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the stroke, the quality of the instrument, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that come upon it; then truly, the Chyrurgian must try, with great diligence, and consider whether the chink he wide enough for the matter to come forth, which ran down through it to the hard membrane of the brain, or not? If it be not broad enough, the Trepan must be set on. Wherefore, the Chyrurgian first of all must foreshew the danger, that the prating of idle people may be prevented. For narrow fractures of the skul, have more danger than those that are broader; for a narrow cleft hinders the matter to come forth. Then he shall presently dilate the wound that is too narrow, either cross waies or with three corners (as the place hurt will admit) with a knife, that he may come at the skul to do his operations there; he shall pull away the lips of the wound and the pannicle of the skull, with his nails, from the bone: which being performed, he shall lay to the bone dry lint; but to the lips of the wound, lint wet with desiccatives, and then proceed with the rest, as in the cures of wounds in the <hi>Pericranium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second or, at most, the third day after the hurt perceived, (where the <hi>dura mater</hi> is pricked by some splint of the bone) the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154387:69"/> skull must be opened with Trepans, whilest the forces of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent yet remain; for after three daies, and so long as inflammation is present or near, the use of the Trepans is dangerous. Neither are they to be hearkned to, who, according to the opinion of <hi>Paulus Lib.</hi> 60. <hi>Cap.</hi> 90. in Summer expect the seventh day, and in Winter the fourteenth; because Trepanning, at that time, brings help too late; for the forces are then weak, and we may suspect that the pannicles of the brain are already infected by the matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chyrurgian, so soon as he is called, shall make hast (only, according to some mens opinion avoiding the full Moon, because then the brain is augmented, and comes near to the skull; so that the Chyrurgian, who is not acquainted with Trepans called <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistoi,</hi> may easily hurt that with the membranes thereof) with his operation, (especially where the membranes are pricked and pressed) because Impostumes soon follow those things, and ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents (as <hi>Guido de Cauliac</hi> admonishes us concerning the wounds of the head) when things to be removed are removed out of the wound; the head being laid unmovable, and the lips of the wound being artificially covered with lint, Table XXXI. Figure V. <hi>(that they may not take cold by the air that comes to them, or be offended by the touch of the instruments)</hi> the skull must be opened with a Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan near to the chink, Table XXXII. Figure III. in that part that is more declining (unless the suture hinder it, which for certain reasons must be avoided as much as may be) for the more easie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of the matter collected upon the hard membrane. But first we must use the male Trepan, in the middle whereof there is a pin, and this must be duly turned about, untill such time as it hath made such a print upon the skul, <hi>that the female Trepan may stand fast upon it.</hi> Then the male Trepan being taken off, the female Trepan must be fitted to the handle, which must be strongly and equally turned about <hi>(untill it come to the thin Table)</hi> and it must be changed now and then, <hi>lest it should grow too hot with often turning about.</hi> New Practitioners find fault with dipping the Trepans in oil, which the Antients used, because unctuous things are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the bone, and dull the edge of the instrument. When the Trepan comes to the glassy Table, it must not only be pressed more warily and gently, but it must be taken off, that we may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture how much remains of the bone yet to pierce through. Nor must <hi>Glandorpius</hi> be followed, who proceeds in piercing, untill such time as the part cut forth cleaves to the Trepan; but if the bone almost cut forth begins to shake, the Chyrurgian must, with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154387:70"/> the smallest and weakest Levitor of all, Table II. Figure VII. (putting that between the bone that shakes, and that which is firm) move it up and down, and pull it forth with the toothed end of the Pullers. <hi>Note, that the operation must not be differed by reason of the blood that runs forth of the Diplois, but must be warily hastned.</hi> For the blood, after terebration, and taking forth of the bone that is fallen down upon the membrane, must be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiped away with cotton wrapt about the spindle of the Probe; and the hole made with the Trepans, must be stopt with dry lint wrapt close together, and that flux must presently be staied.</p>
                  <p>When the Trepanning is over, and the blood well stopped, the roughness of the hole must be made smooth with a lenticular instrument, Table XXXI. Figure VII. If one hole made with the Trepan seems not to be sufficient, we must make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as it shall appear afterwards in the History of <hi>Happelius, Hebichius,</hi> and <hi>Schneiderus.</hi> These things being rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, we must let down, through the hole, a little silken red rag, upon the hard membrane; or else a white linnen rag, round as a globe, fastned to a thread, (that it may be drawn out again) and dipped in compleat oil of Roses made hot, Table XXXI. Figure IX. that it may turn the matter, which falls down, into quitter; and may defend the membranes, by reason of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from being hurt by the bone. The linnen rag being put in, we must put into the hole a round pellet of dry lint, that the quitter bred in the wound, may not descend to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the brain; upon the naked bone we must lay dry lint, the lips of the wound being anointed with some digestive; and upon this we must lay <hi>linimentum simplex</hi> (that it may not stop in the quitter) with a hole in the middle of it; then a cataplasm, and a band, with anointing the parts next to the wound, with repelling oils to hinder inflammation. This way of cure must be exactly observed, untill all fear of inflammation be past; and the Patient must be admonished, that he must daily, when the wound is bound up, promote the coming forth of the matter, that is run to the membranes of the brain, by breathing out at his nose, keeping his mouth shut.</p>
                  <p>When good quitter appears upon the hard membrane; in the place of oil of Roses, <hi>melrosatum colatum</hi> must be let down upon the membrane, with a linnen rag tied to a thread; upon the bone must be laied dry lint, and upon the lips lint wet with some
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154387:70"/> detergent digestive, to mundifie the hard membrane and the wound also outwardly, we must continue the use of <hi>linimentum simplex, Hippoerates</hi> plaister, a band, and astringent oils.</p>
                  <p>If the wound be clean, and the membrane is seen to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from filth, <hi>omitting the silk or linnen rag, and honey of Roses,</hi> we must put into the hole, a round pellet of dry lint; and the naked bone must be strewed with cephatick powder; also to the bone we must lay dry lint, and to the lips lint anointed with some sarcotick unguent, and above these <hi>ceratum Diapalma,</hi> with a treble linnen cloath, wet in the decoction of red wine, with capital remedies, and pressed forth again, and they must be fastned with convenient Ligature. With these we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, untill the bone be covered with good flesh, and the wound be filled up with it. Last of all a cicatrize must be made with Epuloticks. This way of cure I found to be the best in <hi>George Seiz,</hi> a Country-man of <hi>Idelhusan,</hi> concerning whom see <hi>Gregory Horstius</hi> his Chyrurgical Observation XX.</p>

                  <p>OF all the wounds of the head, those are the most dangerous where the temporal muscles are hurt; for they are covered, on the outside, with the <hi>Paricranium,</hi> which passeth above them and wraps them in; but on the inside of them they are naked, and lie upon the naked bone immediately. Wherefore, <hi>vve must observe very vvell,</hi> if the <hi>Pericranium</hi> (which wraps in the said muscles, and hath its original from the internal thick membrane of the brain, by the sutures of the skul) be but lightly inflamed; for this will presently cause the thick and thin membranes, and the brain under them to consent with it: Also the wounds of the temporal muscles are dangerous, by reason of the flux of blood from the arteries which are cut, and which the most choice astringent can hardly stop. In the like case I never found any thing better than <hi>Galen's</hi> plaister <hi>(the commendations vvhereof you shall find in</hi> Zacutus Lusitanus, <hi>Prax. Med. admirand. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv.</hi> 85.) made of Aloes, Frankincense, and the flue of a Hare well beaten together, and mingled with the white of an Egg; with this the wound is filled to stop the Arteries: If by this most precious remedy the blood should not be stopped, which boils forth exceedingly by reason of drunkenness or anger, then four grains of <hi>sperniolum compositum Crollii</hi> are given, with very good success; and about the neck a plaister is applied (whereof <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonus</hi> makes mention in his <hi>Idea Menicinae cap. de haemorag nari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>) made of Potters clay compounded with the most sharp vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger of Roses, and laid upon a band that is four fingers breadth, and renevved as often as it is dried, untill such time as the slux of blood, <hi>commonly vvithin half an hour, or else sooner,</hi> doth stop wonderfully. I thought it fit to mention these three remedies by the way, because they are not only wonderfully forcible to stop the flux of blood from the temples, but it doth infallibly stop a desperate bleeding at the nose, or of the gums, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154387:72"/> follows a violent pulling forth of the teeth, as <hi>Iohan.

The powder taken at the mouth, stops the boiling forth of the blood. The plaister laid upon the wound, joins together the vessels that are cut; and that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the neck, hinders the blood to run to the head. This wound (as also deeper wounds, yet without any hurt to the skull) when the blood is stopt, by the first intention must not be cured; but contrary to <hi>Vesalius</hi> must be filled with flesh, and after that brought to cicatrize; taking especial care that inflammation come not upon it, which must be kept away, and driven from it, by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plaister.</p>

Yet they that resolve, with rasping tools, to scrape away the skul bone superficially corrupted, must expect that the pit shall grow greater. <hi>Wherefore a prudent Chyrurgian must rather omit all manual operation, when he cannot do any good thereby, than to lay an infamy on the rational administration on the Art of Chyrurgery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I being convinced with these reasons, where childrens skuls are pressed down without any rift, or cruel accidents, use to abstain from all manual operation; and being confirmed by frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I cause the hair to be shaved off about the depression. and I apply a hot lamb skin, with convenient ligature of the band called Cancer, anointing the parts about it, especially the temples and the neck, with astringent oils, to hinder the flux of humours to it, and to prevent inflammation. If at the first application the skin do not consume the tumour, I lay on one more, leaving that on again a natural day. When the tumour is discussed, <hi>if the pit is found, by touching, to be small,</hi> and there are no great symptoms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which may portend any hurt of the parts under the skul, I put under the lamb skin, the <hi>ceratum diapalmae</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> spread upon a broad linnen cloath, to coroborate the part affected. That this way of cure is the safest, those Chyrurgians will bear me witness, who have been often my assistants in the like cases; and amongst the chief at <hi>Vlma,</hi> are the most experienced before others, <hi>George Redlin,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Reutte,</hi> whom I thought to nominate for to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same.

                  <head>A Contusion of the head with a depression, but without any fissure in the skul, where the skin is whole in people of years.</head>
                  <p>IN people of years pits are most seldom sound, under the whole skin, upon the skul, (namely, in those only who have a very soft skull by nature) but yet never without a fissure; for if, after incision made upon the skin, there appears no chink upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Table of the skul, it is to be feared that the inward Table is crackt; whereby the matter can fall down upon the brain, but cannot come forth again the same way. <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. I observed such a fracture, at <hi>Vlma,</hi> in a Souldier of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who by reason of a depression of his skul, died the second day after. I, being desirous to know what was the cause of his so sudden death, did with a saw divide his skull; and I found the inward Table not only crackt, but also a little splint of a bone (which doubtless did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually prick the membranes of the brain) that was come from it, and yet the outward Table of the skull was whole. Wherefore, as often as in the heads of men grown up, such a pit is seen, it is a most certain thing that the skull is cleft; for unless the skul were cleft. saith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the middle could not sink down. Yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, and not granting that there may be a depression of a skull more dry, and without a cleft, that must not be left only to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures work (as <hi>Foelix Wurts</hi> commands) but the skin must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be cut with an incision knife, either cross waies, or else triangularly; the <hi>Pericranium</hi> must be parted from the skull, and the gaping wound must be kept with pellets open; not only that the Chirurgian may be more certain whether the skull be cleft; but also that if there be a chink with the depression (which is very much to be feared) a Levitor, that is a convenient instrument, may be made use of.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the incision of the skin, as far as the skull <hi>(if no chink can be seen in the outward Table, nor by no end of the Probe with a knot can be found out, nor that we suspect any fracture in the inward Table of the skull, by reason of symptoms, this being whole)</hi> we must take the triangular part of the Trefine, noted with a star (Table III. Figure I.) wherewith we must gently bore the skull in the center of the depression, <hi>yet not beyond the outward Table.</hi> Having made a hole with the Trefine, the Piercer of the Triploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des must be fastned on, and must be so long turned about by means
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154387:74"/> of the screw above, untill it take a little hold of the inward Table; then the skull, pressed down, must be raised up perpendicularly, by turning the lower screw of the Triploides back again. The skul being raised that was pressed down, the instrument called Triploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des must be removed; and the wound must be dressed as I shewed before, concerning wounds of the head with the skul laid bare, and for the seat of the instrument.</p>

And though most Authours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little thickning of the humour, yet it is apparent by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the Cataract will be more easily couched, <hi>vvhen it is grovvn ripe perfectly.</hi> For that which is not ripe, is yet soft and shotty, and resists not the point of the needle; nor can it be taken away whole, but is cut and grows again, or else it grows harder, or mingled with a watry humour; that not only the sick can see nothing, but also all hope of cure by a second ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (for if it be twice couched it is but in vain) is taken from them; which also useth to fall out, if the crystalline or vitreous humour, or their coats, be hurt by the point of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument; or but only the <hi>uvea,</hi> about the apple of the eye, be torn. By these things it is evident, that this kind of remedy is very doubtfull and uncertain; and by reason of the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154387:77"/> of it, an errour that cannot be mended may easily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: wherefore health must never be rashly promised to the Patient, as Mountebanks use to do <hi>(vvho are never ashamed though they do not perform their promises so they can get by it)</hi> but we must promise to do our best. I, to speak the truth, never tried this manual operation, though I had the instruments ready by me; but I saw it twice performed by an Italian with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, upon one eye of a certain Nobleman of <hi>Padua,</hi> and of a Monk of <hi>Verona.</hi> But the Artist, who was of <hi>Padua,</hi> ordered his manual operation thus: The Patient's body being prepared, and God called upon for his assistance, he chose a private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where the light was moderate; and upon a clear and quiet day, three hours before dinner, he placed the Patient, yet fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on a seat near the bed (at his back there was a bolster or pillow) so that he might look toward the light; on the seat that was opposite the Chyrurgian sate, in a chair with his legs open, and the Patient sitting between his legs, and both his hands leaning on both sides upon his thighs; at the back of the Patient an Assistant (holding the Patient's head firm and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with both his hands) covered his right eye, which was sound, with cotton and a band (see this Table Figure IV.) This being done, the Assistant laid some cushions between the Chyrurgian and the Patient, that the Artist's arm might stand steady. See in <hi>Fabritius Hildanus Cent.</hi> IV. <hi>Observ.</hi> XVI. an instrument whereon the Chyrurgian's arm leans, as upon a block or pillar. This being likewise done, the Chyrurgian with his right thumb rubbed the eye that was ill, shutting his ey-lids, and then presently opening them again; and first chewing Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel seed in his mouth, he did warm the eye with the vapour of it; then he took a golden needle (because the Cataract to be couched was white, but a silver needle is requisite, when the congealed humour is black, or of any other colour) which was long and the handle of it was chamfered and wound about, that he might hold it the faster; and it was most sharp at the point, and was made less by degrees, Table IX. Figure IV: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thrust this in with his left hand, near to the place of the eye, leaning upon the outside of the eye, in the white that is not far distant from the <hi>Iris,</hi> somevvhat above the middle of it; and this he did not do violently, but winding it about by little and little, untill he penetrated the coat called <hi>cornea;</hi> which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154387:78"/> the Patient easily indured, with very little sense of pain: The needle thus thrust in, he by and by directed it tovvard the hole of the <hi>pupilla,</hi> where the Web grevv; and by degrees he brought it to the innermost place of the skin; which was done the more conveniently, because the golden needle might be seen through the <hi>cornea.</hi> With this needle thrust thither gently, and that he might remove the Web from the circumference of the hole, having turned it up and dovvn sometimes (for it doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies succeed the first time) he pressed it dovvn; and when the skin was freed in one part, he did at last separate it with his needle, wheresoever it did yet stick; and he thrust it dovvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the lovvest and obscure part of the eye. When the skin was come belovv the region of the <hi>pupilla,</hi> the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian shut the eye, and left the needle within it for a quarter of an hour, that the Web might stay in the lovver part, into which it was forced, which is known if the skin do not mount up again when the eye is moved. <hi>In the mean vvhile heed must be taken that in couching a Cataract vve do not cut it into many parts;</hi> for those pieces though they be pressed down, yet will they be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily brought up again to the seat of the eye, and floting there will hinder the sight. All these things being rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the couching of the Cataract succeeded well also; the black eye sight began to appear, and the Patient began to see. At length thrusting down the eye-lid, and shutting the eye, he drew out the needle again gently, lest the matter which made the Cataract, should rise up again to its former place, or the vitreous or crystalline humour should be hurt. Nor is there any fear of the watry humour running forth, because the hole made in this thick coat falls down again immediately so soon as the needle is taken out.</p>
                  <p>The operation being thus ended, and the eye being well and sound, yet upon both eyes, kept shut for six daies, he did daily three or four times lay on cotton which was wet on one side with Rose-water and Fennel-water, to which be added a little Saffran and Fennel-seed in powder, for greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration. But to prevent inflammation, he applied to the fore-head a linnen cloath moistned with the white of an Egg beaten, on which were strewed <hi>Galen's</hi> astringent powders; and above the cotton and the defensative, now mentioned, he bound another linnen cloath with a band. From that time
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154387:78"/> the regiment of the Patient's diet was not large; but he was alotted a very spare diet. And that the sight, not yet used to much light, should be overcome by it, he commanded that the Patient should stay for a time in the dark, shutting the wooden windows all about, and should by degrees use him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the light. And also that the spirits might not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the eye with any force, he did forbid all vehement motion, as coughing, sneezing; crying loud, and great straining when the Patient went to stool, or to make water. He lay on his back when he did eat or drink, neither did he rise to go to stool, but he had a Close-stool of wood set under him. And thus the Patient having regain'd his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sight, by a diligent use of Prophylacticks, and by an issue burned in his Arm, he lived safe and well many years. Also a notable Oculist <hi>N. Marianus,</hi> by birth a Roman, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Suffusion, very fortunately, in both eyes, according to <hi>Celsus,</hi> when I stood by in <hi>Vlma,</hi> 1637. in the moneth of December, for Mr. <hi>Tobias Neubronnerus,</hi> and Mistris <hi>Kazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeckin.</hi> And these things shall suffice concerning a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract happily couched, which I have therefore brought out from my Shop of Observations, that such as are studious in Physick, if Mountebanks, who are most commonly trusted to cure these Patients, shall in their presence not proceed as they ought, they might be able to correct them. And since that the manual operation for a Cataract is the most curious of all, <hi>Celsus Libr.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>De natura Oculorum &amp; corum Suffusione,</hi> hath most clearly set it down, to whom I refer the Reader; and he that desireth more, let him read <hi>Plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or <hi>George Bartisch</hi> the Oculist at <hi>Dreson.</hi> For the discussing of Cataracts first beginning, many descriptions of <hi>Collyrium's</hi> are found in Authours, to which they attribute most singular effects. I have tried that the gall of a Pike, with a little Sugar mingled together, after I had purged my whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and had laied on a Vesicatory behind my ears, being dropped into my left eye by my Brother's Son, it resolved in one weeks space a Cataract that was then beginning: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus Spigelius</hi> often used this remedy successefully, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this did very much commend unto me the oil of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a River Weesel (concerning which see <hi>Forestus Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Observat.</hi> 35.) and the eye-water of <hi>Martin Rulandus,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:154387:79"/> and that other which is like to it, as being very good, and much used at Naples. This was described by <hi>Iohn English</hi> in his practice, which he calls the <hi>English Rose,</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> makes mention of it, <hi>Pr. L.</hi> 1. <hi>p</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. yet leaving out the description, which is this: Take Fennel, Rue, Eybright, Vervain, Tormentil, Betony, Roses, wild Endive, Maidenhair, Chickweed, Pimpernel, Swallow wort, Paper, Piony, Vine leaves, Smallage, Agrimonie, Honey-suckles, of each alike, bruise them; and the next day, put them thus bruised in white Wine; the second day in a Boies water who never knew Woman; the third day in Womans milk; and the fourth day in the purest honey; at this time you must distill them, and keep it for your use. I never used these two waters, yet besides my purpose I would propound them to studious young men, that they might trie the effects of them, which were so much commended to me by a most famous Physitian, when they shall have occasion.</p>
                  <p>Fig. V. shews the hole in the greater cauton of the eie, with a coat of the Impostume; upon this hole is a pipe set (<hi>a</hi> Table I. Figure I.) that it may defend the eie; and by pressing the skin near to it, may dull the feeling, whilest the naked or rotten bone is burnt with a red hot iron, made like an Olive (<hi>b</hi> Table XIX. Figure VI.) thrust into the pipe; then lay fine lint on the bone cauterized, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the scale part from the bone; then the hollow Fistula must be join'd together, with a sponge wet in Allum Wine, and pressed forth, and kept down with an instrument with a broad head; when it is glewed together, the wound must be kept drest with Sarcoticks and Epuloticks.</p>
                  <p>Fig. VI. shews the right eie fastned with a ring (<hi>c</hi> Table VIII. Figure V.) and a Polypus hanging down from the right nostril, and the cutting of a tumour with a coat under the skin, risen in the upper jaw: whose coat being unawares broken with a Diamond <hi>(d)</hi> the matter being evacuated, I separated it, as far as the root went, with a broad Probe, from the skin and the muscles under it; which I cut out with a sharp knife (Table XII. Figure II.) and I touched the small bone very well with an actual cauterie (Table XIX. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure VII.) this being done I brought the wound together, with plaisters spread upon linnen.</p>
                  <p>Fig VII. represents a glass vessel (<hi>e</hi> Table VIII.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:154387:79"/> placed beyond them. <hi>Matthaeus Glandorpius</hi> hath written a most elegant Tract of the nature and cure of a Polypus, which those that will cure it shall read with exceeding great profit.</p>
                  <p>Fig. VIII. shews how the cutting of a tumour with a coat, which grew amongst the muscles of the upper lip, as great as a Hen egg, did absolutelie deform a most honest and most beautifull Matron, not without great pain, her lips, for the cutting forth of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, were drawn one from the other with hooks: See underneath a singular Historie.</p>
                  <p>Fig. IX. shews an excrescence of flesh like a sponge in the fore-part of the Palate, risen behind the cutting teeth; it was greater than a Walnut, and as often as it was touched with the finger or tongue, but easilie, it would send forth a great quantitie of blood: Of which accident see underneath an especial observation.</p>

               <p>Fig. III. The sharp Arterie, in affections of the Larinx which are readie to choke us, is most safelie perforated by a Chirurgian who is not ignorant of Anatomie, the way following: The Patient's head being inclined backwards, not only that the sharp Arterie may be seen plainlie; but also that it may be made longer, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous distinctions in it may appear more exactly, a line must be drawn with ink, by the middle and forepart of the length of the neck, almost as far as the hollow part of the throat. Then, with the finger, we must touch the head of the sharp Arterie; next we must exactlie, with the finger, search out the end of the Larinx on the forepart; this being found out, we must descend untill such time as three or four rings of the sharp Arterie be past over (three in those that have but short necks, and four in those that have long necks; which bounds we know either by sense or by reason; by sense, in a lean neck; but by reason, imagining and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the largeness of three rings; in which case we must view the sharp Arterie of one that is well) that there incision may be made; yet not immediatelie under the Larinx, lest inflammation, which easilie follows after incision, should be communicated to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinx, that was before shut too much. The membranous place being thus found out, the middle circle, between two grisly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, must be marked with ink, according to the length of the neck: Afterwards the skin. with the fleshie membrane under it, here and there, being laied hold on with the fingers of the Assistant; namely, with the thumb and fore-finger of both hands, by the length of the line made from the Larinx to the throat <hi>(for so there is no danger that any vessels, nerve or muscle should be hurt)</hi> it must be cut with a crooked knife <hi>(f)</hi> so that the overthwart line be in the middle of the incision; and the incision must be made so long, that being dilated it may contain the thumbs breadth, and may admit the use of the double edged knife <hi>(g.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fig. IV. Incision being made, the lips of the wound must be drawn open with the fingers, and the blood must be wiped away with the sponge <hi>(i)</hi> that the two muscles which lie immediately
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154387:81"/> upon the sharp Artery, and are called <hi>Sternohyoidaei,</hi> may appear. Then the muscles which are distinguished by a certain white line, ate to be drawn asunder, at length, with the haft of the knife <hi>(h)</hi> that the body of the sharp Artery may come to be seen.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. When the Artery appears, the distance must be kept open with a blunt hook here and there, untill incision be made overthwart, between one and the other cartilage by the edge of the divided spatha <hi>(g.).</hi> But the knife must be thrust in so deep, that it may reach the hollow of the sharp Artery; and this is the sign that it is gone in so far, if the breath come forth of the wound with a murmuring noise. Then a pipe of silver <hi>(k)</hi> with holes in it, and crooked, that is exactly as big as the wound made in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is short that it may not touch the insides of the Artery, with shoulders that it may not be suckt in with the breath, and tied with two threads that it may be drawn forth and fastned, must be put into the wound made in the Artery; and there it must be left so long as all fear of inflammation is past. Then the pipe must be drawn forth, and renewing, if need be, the wound of the skin and fleshy membrane by scarification, the lips must be drawn together and stitched; and being so brought together, they must be kept so with plaisters spread upon linnen cloath, and with convenient ligature,</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. represents a seton burnt into the tip of the left ear, to intercept the matter that ran thence continually, by a vein pricked through with a needle and burnt, to nourish and augment the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which hanging by a thicker basis from the neck, by reason of the angular veins, and the inward branch of the carotick Artery, can neither be cut off, nor yet separated from the skin. The Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char being taken away with butter, I put first into the seton a ring of lead, untill that was perfectly healed; after that I put in a gold ring with a rich pearl in it, instead of the leaden ring, such a one as your Arabian women hold a great grace to wear in the laps of both their ears: With this putting in of rings, not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the tumour was hindred, but also by accident it grew so small, that the noble Patient, wearing a stomacher, could easily hide it. See Table XXXV. Figure II. of cutting forth and ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating a tumour contain'd in a cover.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. shews the cauterizing of the hinder part of the head, of people in years, with a red hot iron that is round, where there is danger of an Apoplex and other sleepy diseases. But the hollow of the hinder part of the head useth to be cauterized with a red hot
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154387:81"/> iron, especially in children new born, and those that suck the breasts who are frequently troubled with the Falling-sickness, by reason of a cold and moist temper of their brain. For the cure and preservation from this disease, Physick hath found out a present remedy; namely, to burn the hinder part of the neck; which is as it is a most safe way, so it doth most commonly make revulsion, derivation and evacuation of the phlegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, with apparent good which burthen the head. Hence it is that cauterizing the nape of the neck is so common in some places; that at Florence none or very few children are found, that are not so cauterized presently after they are baptized. The hair therefore being shaved off, we must make an iron instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment red hot, which is the oval and long fashioned (Table VII.) fit for the hollow of the hinder part of the head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first and second vertebra of the neck; wherewith, when the danger is small in tender age, and when the paroxysm is off, it must be touched only once lightly; but when the danger is greater in riper age, in the paroxysm, and when for many daies the place must be kept open, the iron instrument must be thrust on deeper twice or thrice. Afterwards we must apply to the place cauterized, either butter with <hi>Diapalma,</hi> or else <hi>Triapharmacum,</hi> that the Eschar may fall off; which being taken away, the ulcer must be kept open so long as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and must be let run with <hi>ceratum sacrum</hi> or <hi>Diachylon.</hi> Last of all let it be brought to cicatrize with <hi>ceratum de Cerusta,</hi> or some other healing medicament. A Seton in the same place made with three instruments; namely, with the Cizers, a red hot Needle, and a Seton, voids forth the humours that fill the head, by putting them back from the eys to the neck; it makes derivation of those that fall down to the jaws and throat; and it intercepts those which fall on the <hi>spina dorsi,</hi> and the joints of the limbs. <hi>But since there is so great benefit of a seton,</hi> I <hi>thought good, for the help of Students, to set down the reason and manner hovv to make it, both in vvords and figures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Patient must sit on a low seat, and the Physitian with his forefinger must search out the place fit for a seton, or that cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is between the first and second vertebra of the neck. When he hath found this, the hair must be presently shaved off, and the place to be bored through must be marked long waies with writing ink, so that the line may be in the middle of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154387:82"/> hollow; but that the said middle place may not be missed, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient must hold his neck streight to the Chyrurgian; then the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian shall also mark both the holes, that must be made both on the right side and on the left, with writing ink, that the distance between both marks may be one finger and a half broad, more or less as the Patient's skin is thick or thin.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. The place being marked, and the ink dried, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient must so lean back with his head, that the skin and fleshy pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle may be relaxed; then the Chyrurgian shall fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Figure I, II, III.) that are fit for it, he shall lay hold of them, draw them to him and bind them fast, as hard as the Patient can well indure it, or rather untill it causeth pain; that so the nerves being bound, the part to be bored through may grow senceless almost, and the Patient may less feel the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instrument, which otherwise is painfull enough: But he shall so lay hold of the skin and membrane with his Pincers, that the line drawn before on the length of the cavity, and the marks of the holes, to be made on both sides, may be seen through the holes of the Pincers exactly. Then he shall thrust in the needle (<hi>n</hi> Table VII.

The daies that follow, commonly untill the sixth day, before he doth draw the silk by degrees, sometimes to the right hand, and sometimes to the left, he must anoint that part of the silk which must be drawn under the skin, with some digestive; and on the outside he shall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154387:82"/> lay a four double cloath pressed out with the same medicament, untill such time as the ulcer breeds good quitter, and the fear of inflammation is over. Then the silk must be drawn under the skin, with this or the like unguent first being anointed:

               <p>Fig. II. shews 1. the pulling forth of the hairs on the ey-lid according to <hi>Paulus</hi> his way: The ey-lid must be inverted with the fingers, the hairs that prick and hurt the ey must be pulled forth with pullers, and the skin must be cauterized with a little knock at the end of the probe made red hot, that it may be candensed and the hairs may no more grow upon it. 2. The cutting forth of an Atheroma, which bred in the middle of the forehead, and was greater then a Walnut: In this Figure the skin is cut which covers the case of the Atheroma, overthwart with a crooked knife; but in the fourth Figure long waies, that the whole Impostume may be taken forth with its coat. Effects worth consideration do follow the incision made on the forehead overthwart; for the fibras of the muscles of the forehead being cut overthwart, the ey brows hang down, and hinder the opening of the ey-lids; also there follows an incurable palsie of the ey-lids, by reason of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the nerves; which thing was proved by <hi>Adrianus Spigelius,</hi> upon a small wound only on the nerve of the forehead, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in <hi>Fabr. corp. hum. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. But because this kind of Tumor arose in the middle of the muscles of the forehead, and the overthwart incision did hurt to very few fibras of the muscles, there followed upon this no palsie or other inconvenience, which might hinder the eye lids to be lifted up. But that the cutting forth of this Atheroma may be better understood, I shall very brieflie set down the cure of Tumors that are covered with coats.</p>
               <p>Tumors with coats; as <hi>Meliceris, Atheroma</hi> and <hi>Steotoma,</hi> hang forth either as figs by a slender stalk, (Table XXXIII. Figure II.) or else with a larger root they stick within any part. Those that hang forth are not cut out, but are cut off at the roots in timerous people, a thread being bound about the part to stupifie it, and left there till the swelling falls off; but in stout men they are cut away with a sharp knife. But if the blood runs forth abundantlie after that the Tumor is cut away, or the thread leaves any part of the root behind, then, that we may not fear that it should grow any more, the place must be lightlie touched with a red hot iron, and when the escar is fallen, we must heal it up again. This way of manual operation is most readie, and by reason the ulcer is but small and equal, the cure is soon done. Those that lie upon the parts with a larger basis, they are either small ends or mean ends, or greater, or very great: the small ends are as big as a small nut, the mean ends are as big as a Walnut, the greater as big as an Egg, and the greatest of all are as big as a Pompion. The greatest of all,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:154387:84"/> by reason of veins and arteries, cannot be taken forth, wherefore they must be cut off. But amputation or cutting them off accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hierom. Fabrit. ab Aquapend.</hi> is done with Pincers, which receive and take fast hold of the whole Impostume as far as the roots of it; which afterwards to hinder the flux of blood, is cut away with red hot knives with sharp edges, all above the pincers, (such a pair of pincers as <hi>Guil. Fabrit. Hildan.</hi> describes <hi>cent.</hi> 1. <hi>observ.</hi> 2.) without drawing the skin from the bag. Then the place must be dressed with digestives, cleansers, sarcoticks and epule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. The rest are cut forth and not cut off; the cutting of them forth is performed thus: First of all the Patient must be placed as commodiously as he can be, either on a seat or on a bed opposite to the clear light and to the Chirurgian; and if it be a fearful child or woman, or one that is faint-hearted, he must be bound with his hands behind him, lest either being impatient of pain, he should divers waies with his hands hinder the Operator in his operation, or being frighted he should toss himself every way, as <hi>Marcus Aurel. Severin.</hi> out of <hi>Hippocrates de offic. Med.</hi> warns us <hi>L. de abscessib. anon. cap.</hi> 23. The Patient being seated, the hairs must be shaved away, (if the Tumor be on the head, or else there is no need to do that) and with ink we must mark out the length we mean to cut, which must be as much as the tumor is in round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; sometimes the Tumor requires a double incision, like to a cross on the skin, and then the first incision must be longer then the second. There is made but one incision upon a small and mean Tumor, especiallie when it sticks to the muscle of the fore head or temples, lest their fibras or vessels should be burnt overthwart. A Tumor that is next to a mean, called a greater, requires to be cut like to a cross; and a Tumor that is covered with hair will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the same incision also: Yet in a single and cross fashioned incision, we must take care that the bag underneath the skin be not cut asunder, especiallie in <hi>Meliceris,</hi> for then the humor runs forth, and the tumor falls, so that the bag can hardlie be taken out. And it is necessary that the coat which contains matter like to honie, or to pap, should be taken out whole; for if but the least part of it be left behinde, it will be the occasion to make it grow again: But in Steatoma, whereas that fattie tallow, or the more solid substance of the suet hardlie will run forth, there is not so great danger in hurling the bag; and if the tumor do not fall down, the coat may be pulled away very easilie; wherefore the crooked knife, with which onlie the skin must be cut, must have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154387:84"/> an edge on the outside that is turned back and blunted, (Fig. II.) incision being made, either but one at length, or two like a cross; the larger part of the probe (Table VIII. Figure VI.) must be thrust in between the skin and the bag, which hath another colour then the skin hath; and with this the bag laid hold on must be parted from the skin which will be easily done, because the bag doth not stick very fast to the skin: But if the bag round about do stick more fast to the skin, it must be parted with the edge of the knife held slanting, (Table II. Figure I.) and it must be separated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath with the handle of the knife, (Table XII. Figure IV.) whilst you do make this separation, the blood that runs forth must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie wiped away with a sponge, that it may not hinder the Operator in his work. If the Chyrurgian come to the bottom of the bag, he must cut the vein that brings nourishment to the tumor; with the edge of the knife overthwartly, that not so much as the least part of the bag may be left, to breed the tumor again. This being done, and the bag perfectly drawn forth, he shall join together the lips of the wound, (which if they be very loose, shew that the skin is too much, and he must cut off the skin that is superfluous, letting stitching alone at this time, by reason of the great pains the Patient hath endured already) laying plaisters upon linnen cross wise. Thus did I most happily cure two Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romas, that were as big as Goose-eggs, upon the knee of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Priest.</p>
               <p>But if the bag be already broken, either of it self, or by the carelesness of the Chyrurgian, then it is necessary that either the tumor grow again, or that there remain in that place almost an incurable and stinking ulcer, where we must consider the time when it broke. If it be broken now, we must thrust in between the skin and the bag the greater end of the probe, or handle of the penknife, untill such time as the membrane of the tumour be totallie separated. But if it break long before, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with septicks in those that are more fearful, or with red hot irons in those that are more stout hearted. This being wasted, the wound must be digested, cleansed, and incarnated and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized. See <hi>Aetius Tetrab.</hi> 4. <hi>serm.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7, 8. and <hi>Celsus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. of the cure of <hi>Meliceris, Steatoma</hi> and <hi>Atheroma</hi> by manual operation, which he describes in these words; shaving first all the hair off, if they are covered with hair, you must make incision through the middle, <hi>either long ways, or with a cross;</hi> but the coat of Steatoma must be cut also, that what is within it may run
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:154387:85"/> forth, because that coat is not easilie parted from the skin and the flesh of the muscles under it; but in the rest, namelie <hi>Meliceris</hi> and <hi>Atheroma,</hi> the bag must be kept untouched and whole; but forthwith, as the skin is cut, the white coat stretched out shews it self; and then with the haft of the knife the coat must be parted from the skin and flesh, and must be cast out with that is contained within it: Yet if at any time the coat sticks fast to the muscle on the lower part, that that may not be hurt, the upper part of that coat must be cut away with a pair of cizers, and the other part under must be left within; when the whole coat is taken forth, the lips of the wound must be joined, and a band or suture must make them fast, (if the sick can away with it) and above all must be laid a glutinative medicament: when the whole coat, or half, which sticks fast to the muscle, or any part of the coat is left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, after corrosives, or a little fire, things must be applied which cause quitter.</p>

This way of cure succeeds singularly well, because it not only dries up what moisture is run in, but it also hinders all new flux of humors; which thing I tried upon a Noble-woman, witness <hi>Georgius Bamlerus,</hi> who would not believe it, till he saw the effect of it with admiration.</p>

But this manual operation, and that which follows, is used not to recover the sight already

               <p>Fig. IV. shews a Palate eaten away with the French Pox, so that the hole passed through into the cavitie of the nose, and hindred the voice from being articulatelie pronounced; this I stopt with a golden Instrument, to which a sponge was fastned, whereby the Patient spake his words plainlie and distinctlie. After the use of the decoction, I touched that hole with red hot irons, which nature, after that some small bones were cast off, filled with flesh; when the ulcer was filled with flesh, I brought it to cicatrize with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garisms and drying Errhius.</p>

For the foresaid instrument not onlie depresses the tongue, but it also keeps the nether jaw pressed down, untill such time as the place affected be more nearlie searched out, medicaments may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to it, with the spatula set on the side thereof, and perforated with many holes; sometimes only the tongue is put down, that the faults of the mouth may be seen: The more thick excrements of the tongue are scraped away with the crooked side of the Spatula, which has an edge, and these in very hot burning feavers commonlie stick fast to it.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. shews the way to cut the string under the tongue that is too strait, and as some think hinders mens speech; which Midwives every where tear asunder with their nailes, and our Barbers imprudentlie rend it with a lancer, oft-times with a great flux of blood, and pain, which afterwards proves the cause of other michiefs; which thing <hi>Hierom Fabrit. ab Aquap.</hi> relates in these words following, annexing withal how we ought to perform this manual operation: Besides the depression of the tongue, and scraping of it, there is a third way of manual operation to be performed about the tongue, when the string under the tongue is cut; of which before I speak, I would give you warning of the rashness of Midwives every where, who in all, making no difference, cut the string under the tongue in every new born child, with the nails of the fore finger, which they ever keep ready and sharp for that purpose; which office if they should not perform, they cannot believe that the childe will ever speak; as if by nature (O the wonderful and not sufficiently to be lamented ignorance of almost all Midwives) a man could not speak, who hath by nature speech given to him as his proper faculty, without any help of any foolish woman to assist her. And I saw a childe new born, whilest he was kept in longer then he might stay for the secondines, he neither cried nor felt any trouble; but after that the Midwife unwisely cut the string of his tongue with her nail, he presently fell to crying for pain that he endured: But this is the smallest matter, that truly is of most concernment, namely, that because of that cutting with the nails, oft-times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154387:88"/> cannot lay hold of the nipple of the mother or nurse, nor yet suck the milk, but die for want of it; or else breasts swell that give suck, or which is yet far worse, the parents impute the fault hereof either to hard labor in childe-birth, or coming before the time, or else to the weakness of the childe only to lay hold on the nipple, or to any other cause, rather then to the fault of the Midwife; which being it is the true cause, I much wonder that there is not a provisional Law made to hinder the death of children, which is oft-times procured by Midwives: wherefore I admonish you, that you forbid Midwives to touch the tongues of yours or your friends children with their nails. And if perchance that string under the tongue be greater then it should be, it may be cut at any age, which yet seldom, and very seldom indeed, happens to this string; because Nature would not have made man fit to speak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she had made and granted unto him fit instruments for that purpose: And if of an hundred thousand children one child is born with a greater string, where manual operation is needful, there is no difference whether it be cut presently, or after delivery, or after the childe is weaned, or in longer time, so it be done by a skilful Chyrurgian. If this happen, we use to command the Patient to put his tongue beyond his teeth, which <hi>Celsus</hi> indeed laies hold on with the toothed part of the pullers, but we do it with the pincers; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we cannot lay hold of the tongue either with pullers or pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as in infants and children, who either will not or know not how to put forth their tongues; for these we must make them cry; then putting a thin and rugged linnen cloth between two fingers, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fore-finger and thumb of the left hand, whereby the tongue must be laid hold on and pulled forth, and may be pulled upwards and laid crooked, that the strings may appear, which after this we must cut with the right hand: And taking (not the lancer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used by the Barbers, unfit for that purpose) but the penknife that is moderately hooked about the point, we cut the string of the tongue, if it be greater then it should be, overthwart, once, twice, and again, until it be all cut, taking great care that the vessels under it be not hurt, which cannot happen where the Chyrurgian is skilled in Anatomy, who knows exactly the vessels under the tongue, and avoids them with the crooked knife. Thus far <hi>Hier. Fab. ab Aquap.</hi>

               <p>Fig. IX. teaches how a fish-bone, or a bone with corners, or any thing else sticking in the throat, whilest we eat, and not going down into the stomach, may be drawn forth with convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, or else forced down into the stomach: These strange
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:154387:89"/> things are drawn forth divers waies; if they lie in sight, they are laid hold on with the right pullers, Table IV. Figure I. and are pulled out of the throat, putting in the <hi>Speculum oris</hi> in the mean time; and if a thorn or bone, or any other things, when the mouth is open, and the tongue is pressed down by the <hi>Speculum oris,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to be seen, when they are sunk down deeper into the throat, then being laid hold on with the crooked pullers, Table X. Figure I. they must be drawn forth with the Instrument, Table X. Figure II. thrust into the throat, and hitting against them. Others after meat provoke the stomach to vomit, putting their fingers, or feathers anointed with oil of sweet Almonds, into the throat, that together with the meat, a thorn, or any strange thing, may be cast out of the mouth. But since oft-times the putting forth of bones and thorns is in vain attempted by the said waies or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, <hi>Hierom Fabrit, ab Aquapend.</hi> takes a candle of white wax, as great as a mans little finger, and somewhat crooked, which he delivers to the Patient, that he may thrust that into his own throat, untill such time as the strange bodie may, being forced, go down into the stomach.</p>
               <p>Others for the same purpose command us to swallow down great gobbets; some tie a leaden bullet fast to a thread, and they swallow this often, and pull it forth again, and so what sticks fast in the throat, is thrust into the stomach; when any thing sticking in the throat can neither be taken forth at the mouth, nor forced down into the stomach, <hi>Fabrit. ab Aquap.</hi> from <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> leaves the whole business to nature and time.</p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:154387:90"/> spoken before, Table IX. Figure III, IV, V and VI. I cured a Tailor at Padua who kept the house by reason of an ozaena from the French pox, which after the inward use of the decoction of <hi>gnaicum,</hi> for two whole years was dressed by a principal Barber of that place, with medicaments prepared with Antimony and Mercury. But when these could do no good, the Patient by the Chyrurgian sought the advice and help of D. D, <hi>Spigelius;</hi> but <hi>Spigelius</hi> at that time was sick and could not go forth to see the Patient, wherefore he joined me with that Chyrurgian in ordinary, and he commanded me to make a tent of fine lint. and that I should thrust that into the nostril that was ill, and that I should leave it there for a natural day, that so we might learn the scituation, quantity and quality of the ozaena; I obeyed his command and pulled forth the tent, which I found near the point, and on the right side, foul with a round spot, and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king exceedingly, and I shewed this to <hi>Spigelius,</hi> who so soon as he saw this, said that the ulcer was in the supream part of the nostrils; namely upon the grisly part, and that on the right side not very great, but it was join'd with corruption of the bone, which required cauterizing. When I asked him the reason of what he had said, he gave this which follows; because the tent is foul almost at the point, the ulcer hath its scituation in the top of the nostril; and because the tent is only spotted outwardly, of necessity the left side only is affected, yet with no very great ulcer, because the spot is small; but the bone is also corrupted with it, because the tent is black and stinks exceedingly; there is need of manual operation, because for so long time, untill now, such medicaments have been applied in vain, which had not the bone been corrupted also, would have brought the ulcer to cicatrize long since. He left this manual operation or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nostril through a pipe unto my care, as being very easie and the first of my manual operations; wherefore I chose a pipe (for <hi>Spigelius</hi> had divers) fit for the purpose (namely that which had a hole in the side, described Table VII. Figure IV.) and I wrapt that in lint pressed out with sharp black wine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the parts that were sound; this I thrust into the nostril that was ulcerated, that the hole of the said pipe might equal the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; the pipe being thus prepared and thrust into the nostril, I took the iron instrument, Table IX. Figure VI. made very red hot, and this I thrust through the pipe unto the place affected,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154387:90"/> and I drew the same presently forth again; and thus I did pulling the red hot iron out, and putting it in again, four or five times at the most; <hi>but I did this very suddenly, and therefore two red hot irons are requisite, as I admonished in the place quoted.</hi> After cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terizing, Nature, (the pain being first abated, and the eschar taken off) being helped by medicaments, separated the scale from the bone in fourteen daies; and the ulcer, with drying things applied to it, was brought to cicatrize,</p>
               <p>I tried this manual operation afterwards, in many, with happy success (though the Germans, and chiefly those of Ulma, do exceedingly abhor all caute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>izing by fire) alwaies closing both the Patient's eys with cotton and a band over it, to hinder them from the sight of the red hot iron.</p>
               <p>An Ozaena of the nostrils be it with or without suspicion of the French Pox, but without any rottenness of the bone, if it cannot be cured with medicaments, requires a pipe that is all solid, Table IX. Figure V. which, to speak the truth, I never used myself, neither did I ever see any man else do it. But a certain Student of Millan told me that <hi>Hierom. Fabrit. ab Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendente,</hi> did with most happy success cauterize him with a red hot iron thrust through a pipe that was all solid.</p>
               <p>Without doubt the way he went was that which the Authour hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It must be so done that the red hot iron may heat the pipe, and the pipe the nostrils and the ozaena; yet I desire not that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils should feel any pain by this heat, but that the place ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated might be healed without feeling any pain, as hot only as the Patient can well indure it; when you find that, then must the pipe presently be pulled forth of the nostrils, and then thrust in again; and so often must the red hot iron be thrust in and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, which may only heat untill such time as the part is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently tried; for by often doing of it, and the heat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But at what time? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> seems to have intimated that unto us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>epid. sect.</hi> 7, <hi>text.</hi> 9. we must presently open those whose Thorax is hydropical; but we must presently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize, with hot irons, those which are in Consumptions.

                  </gap> here, signifies less; as if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had said, that those that are hydropical must not be so soon opened or cauterized; but those that consume must be presently opened or cauterized. The reason is, because where men are hydropical, the matter is collected in the Thorax by little and little, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need to make incision presently at the beginning; for so at length that collection will do hurt when it is in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity But such as are in Consumptions, having impostumes in their Lungs, do as it were at one time collect all the matter when the impostume breaks, wherefore the Thorax must be presently opened. 1. That the Patient may not be choaked by reason of the dilating of the Lungs, hindred by the quantity of the corrupt matter. 2. Lest that from the corroding corruption, any ulcer should breed in the Lungs or other part of the Thorax, which can hardly, or not at all, be cured afterwards.</p>
               <p>In what place? The place must be such wherein incision may be safely made; now the places are many, before, behind, on the sides, above or below; but neither before nor behind is the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Thorax good or safe, by reason of the muscle of the breast, and the muscles of the back, which are full of nerves, which are very dangerous to be cut; wherefore it remains that the opening must be made on the side, and that below or above, for on the side the muscles do not stick so fast to the breast, yet before sometimes; namely on the region of the Sternon; if the matter be collected between the <hi>mediastinum,</hi> apertion is wont to be made. Wherefore <hi>Paulus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. opens the Thorax in the upper part of the side: But <hi>Hippocrates lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Morbis,</hi> in the lower part.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> openeth the breast between the third and fourth rib,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154387:92"/> counting from the lower ribs; and the reason is, because by this means the matter and other things contained in the Thorax will run forth the better; and he chuses the place where there is that eminence and binding of the ribs, to which the muscles grow; but not upon it, or backwards towards the back, because the nervous muscles there, hinder the opening of that place; but it must be done a little forward, or toward the Sternum; (Table XXXVII. Figure II. ♃) There seems indeed in this place to be danger, by reason of the Diaphragma, least that should be hurt; yet there is no danger, because the Diaphragma, where it sticks to the ribs, doth not rise so high, (for it is kept down by the matter) that it cannot be hurt; but where the matter is collected, there we must attempt to open the part. If it be on the left side, let the Thorax be opened on the left side; if it be on the right side, open on the right side; if on both, open both sides. But of these places mentioned, that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is to be chosen; because the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of strange matter collected in the Thorax, by reason of the more declining situation of the part opened, will come forth better then it will where <hi>Paulus</hi> appoints the orifice to be made; yet this is not simply to be despised, for if the matter be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently considered, and the orifice be to be made on the right side, the place <hi>Paulus</hi> appoints is better then the place of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> because on the right side, the liver with its gibbous part drives the Diaphragma upward; but on the left side the place of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is best made choice of, because the Diaphragma, by reason of the more low situation of the spleen, and plenty of matter, may be thrust down towards the lower parts; wherefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saith, <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>de Morbis,</hi> It were to be wished, that the matter would alwaies lie down on the left side to be evacuated, or lower then <hi>Paulus</hi> his place, namely, between the sixth and seventh rib, (☉ Table XXXVII. Figure II.) for the Diaphragma doth not ascend so high in those that are living, as in those that are dead; wherefore in these places, the Thorax is opened without offence done to the Pericranium, Lungs, or Septum Transversum.</p>
               <p>But the way is this; The opening of the Thorax is performed either by incision, burning or perforation. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes mention of incision and burning, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 47. when he saith, Whoever are impostumated, must either be burnt or cut, &amp;c. but he speaks of cauterizing, <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>de Morbis.</hi> In all these three waies, we must consider the Patient's lying down, his breathing, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and the operation.

Then a silver pipe (of this Table Figure IV. B.) must be put in, that the liquor poured in morning and evening may be let forth, (for that which is poured into the Thorax in the morning, will come forth by the evening; and what is poured in at evening, will come forth by morning) After the fifteenth day that incision hath been made, instead of a silver pipe, put in a tent of lint smeared with white wax, hollow, least the wound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into an incurable fistula, or the matter remain in the Thorax. When the Thorax is wholly dried, put in a hollow tent of lint, made up with wax, that for length and thickness must daily be made less, untill such time as the wound filled with flesh may be covered with a cicatrize. But where the matter is watry, or thin corruption, presently after that the Thorax is opened, a pipe must be put into the hole, that fits it exactly; and into the pipe a tent tied to a thread, that the water or thin corruption may not run forth all at once, and the sick die, (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Aph.</hi> 27.) but that so much of the matter only may be let forth, as the Patient's forces can suffer. But if by reason of the coldness of the Ague, or any other cause, it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to let out the matter once or twice a day, we must put a small sponge into the pipe, found in this Table Figure W.

               <p>A wound upon any part of the Thorax, either penetrates and perforates the Pleura, or it doth not penetrate nor prick that: Again, it is either a narrow wound or a broad; and both of these either with hurt done to the parts within, or with no hurt done to them.</p>
               <p>A wound of the Thorax received below the sixth rib, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating into the cavity, and not hurting the inward parts, yet is broad enough, it must never be stitched or cured by the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, least the passage for the matter to come forth, which is run into the hollow of the Thorax, may be stopt up, with danger to the Patient's life; but first a tent must be put in, made of raw lint, tied to a thread, (least when the breath is drawn in, it be suckt into the Thorax) and wet in such things as stop blood, that the wound may remain open; on the second and the daies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the wound must be digested with a tent made of a linnen cloth a little worn, and anointed with medicaments that move corruption; and it must be kept open, that the matter collected within may freely come forth.</p>
               <p>And if the matter collected in the Thorax be gross, and not fit to come forth by the wound, it must be attenuated by injecting lotions for some daies, made of the decoction of Barly, Raisins, and Hony of Roses, and a silver pipe must be put into the wound, (of this Table Figure IV. B) anointed with a digestive, and stopt with a sponge, (of the same Table Figure IV. D) and covered with a little cap C, of the same Table, that the matter and the decoction cast in may be purged forth by little and little; when the corrupt matter is conveniently purged forth, instead of the silver pipe with shoulders, a tent must be put in made of waxed lint, and hollow, and wet with a sarcotick medicament, which must every day, as I said before, be made less and shorter, that it may not hinder the breeding of the flesh; when the said wound is narrow, it must be presently dilated with the sharp knife, (E of this Figure) to let forth the matter. A wound piercing in above the fifth rib of the Thorax, be it large or narrow, must be kept open with a tent wet in desiccating medicaments, and tied by a thread, that the same day or the next, the blood which is not yet congealed in the Thorax, may be let forth by a pipe put into it, of this Table Figure IV.

               <p>In wounds of the Thorax with a small incision of the Lungs or Diaphragma in the fleshy part, we must not only attempt to drive out the matter by the wound, either of it self large enough, or dilated by an incision knife, or by some new hole made, or by the urinary passages; but we must pour into the Thorax, by a syringe, first a decoction that binds the bleeding veins: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, one that attenuates the thick matter: Thirdly, one that cleanseth the inward wound: And lastly in the fourth place one that will heal it.</p>
               <p>When a wound pierceth into the Abdomen, the caul or the intestines slip forth; if the caul be slipt forth, we must consider whether it be yet sound or corrupted; if it be sound, then it must be presently washed in hot wine, and be gently put in again with ones fingers; then the lips of the wound must be drawn together again till they touch one the other; and being so drawn it must be kept so with stitchings, described Table XXXIX. Figure V. But if the Siphac be corrupted, it must be drawn forth, and must be tied very strongly with a single red silk; and then the part that is corrupted, that is bound, must be cut off above the thread, with a sharp knife; but the rest which is sound must be washed in hot wine, and must be gently reduced into the Abdomen, the long thread hanging forth without side; then the wound must be joined with sutures now mentioned; yet so that some space may be left where the thread hangeth forth: but if the Intestines be come forth, they must presently, before they be filled with wind, be thrust in again gently with the fingers, without violence, and so be hid under the Abdomen.

Lastly, on the sutures of the guts put in again, you must strew powders of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, Mastick, Pellitory of Spain, &amp;c. and the wound of the Abdomen must be united with latchets.</p>
               <p>The nipples of those that give suck (I) are oftentimes so hid within the breasts, that the Child new born can neither take hold of them with its mouth, nor suck any milk out of them. In such a case let either the childs nurse set either the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the glass (pictured Table XVI. Fig. I.) to the nipple that lies hid, and lay hold of the mouth of the pipe with her mouth, and draw forth the nipple by sucking; or one that is of years shall set the long glass (K) to the nipple, and with a band shall bind it fast to the breast; and when this is done, let her take the narrower end of the glass between her lips, and drawing as before, let her suck forth the nipple that lieth hid. <hi>Amatus Lusitanus</hi> silleth a glass with a narrow mouth L with scalding water, which he poureth forth again when the glass is made very hot with it, and he presently claps the mouth of the glass to the nipple; for this presently sticks fast to the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and draws it out so forcibly, that the Child may easily lay hold of it with its mouth. Moreover these instruments not only draw out the nipples, but milk also. But if there be no need to draw forth milk with the nipple, a thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:154387:95"/> made of Ivy wood, is most safely set on to draw forth the nipples.</p>

               <p>Fig II. and III. shew the place, the manner, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for to use the paracentesis, performed upon the Abdomen of hydropical people. Also about this manual operation there are four things to be considered: 1. Whether it be to be done? 2. At what time? 3. In what place? 4. After what manner? Whether it be to be done, is signified by the disease and the forces of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, whether the disease be Ascites only, or water be mingled with the other kindes of dropsies; namely, if the tumour of the Abdomen, especially from the much drinking of water, came in a short space to a huge magnitude, and medicaments given at the mouth help not, because the vertue of them cannot be brought into act, the natural heat being oppressed with the plenty of humor. The forces must be firm, which may be known when the sick can stand upright, or sit on a seat and finde no inconvenience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the disease is old, and the forces are weak, (the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations whereof are old age, child hood, coughs, scouring, cachoxia, a burning fever preceding, and a schirrus, and corruption of the bowels) manual operation hath no place there. The time is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; namely, before the humor shut up in the Abdomen, hath brought any notable hurt to the bowels and other inward parts. The place where Paracentesis is made, is either in the navil or under the navil, three or four fingers broad of the Patient being put between, and that on the right side or left side, but never in the middle of the Abdomen by a white line; where the navil is so relaxed or swoln, that between the outward part, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cavity and water, only a very thin skin passeth, which is

               <p>The manner comprehends the situation of the Patient, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and reason of the operation: The Patient, who by reason of water hath his paunch much swoln and stretched forth, must be laid in his bed upon his back, or else must sit upon a low seat. The instruments wherewith the bellies of hydropical people are most commodiously opened, are of two sorts; namely, either the instrument consisting of a pipe with shoulders, H, and a needle, I, Table XII. Figure XVII. to perforate the navil with, or the pen-knife K a little blunted at the point, and having an edge only on one side, Table XII. Figure I. to open the Abdomen below the navil. The navil is most safely perforated, if the instrument with a pipe, Table XII. Figure XVII. be sewed to a band, and that be thrust into the middle of it L, untill it come to the star marked upon it; after this the needle must be taken forth of the pipe, and the pipe must be thrust into the Abdomen as far as the shoulder of it, and must be left there. Incision when it is needful below the navil varieth much: <hi>Fallopius</hi> makes his incision thus; first he cuts the skin overthwart the Abdomen an inch broad with a crooked knife, and that is blunt on the other side; this being cut, he cuts the rest warily with a pen knife, wherewith the Germans open a vein to let blood, namely with a common lancet. <hi>Hierom Fabrit ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quapend.</hi> useth the same knife <hi>Fallopius</hi> doth; but he puts that into the skin a little slanting, untill he penetrate as far as the hollow region, and have also perforated the peritonaeum. That the knife penetrated as far as the hollow part, not only is shewed by the water coming forth, but it is known by a Chyrurgian exercised in opening impostumes, when as nothing resists when he presseth; when incision is made, he pulls forth his knife, and puts in a small pipe of silver well polished, with shoulders, and with holes in the sides of it, longer the first time (and afterwards shorter N, which may only go into the cavity) at the end slanting, exactly fitted to the knife, and tied to a band, that it may not slip out of the hole O; by this pipe he lets out the watry humor, not all at one time, but so much as the Patient's strength will suffer, which is known most perfectly and certainly by the pulse. The wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:154387:99"/> humor being let forth in a due quantity, he doth not draw forth the pipe, but leaves it in the Abdomen; and he shuts it with a tent of lint P, that he may again let forth the water afterwards. Hydropical persons perforated, must be kept most diligently, that the band may not be loosed, they not being sensible of it, and the pipe fall out, and so the water run all out at one time, and kill the Patient, for so this only remedy of so great a disease may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced. Following <hi>Fabritius, An.</hi> 1625. on the 7. day of <hi>August,</hi> I opened the Abdomen of a certain noble Virgin at Ulma, who was sick of an Ascites, Anasarca, and Tympany, and she lived one year and a half very sound after this perforation; afterwards she died sick only of a perfect Tympany.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. represents the incision of a Fistula of the Thorax, which was done suddenly and almost in a moment, with a Syringotomus, which at one end hath an edge Q, Table XIV. Figure I. and the point of it was wrapt about with a small button of wax R, that when it was thrust in, it might not rend the flesh; then it is thrust into the Fistula, and when it comes to the bottom of it, it is forced through the skin and flesh above, with the right hand; so that the bottom of wax remaining in the ulcer, the point of the knife may come forth by the hole made, which being laid hold on by the fingers of the left hand, the distance between both holes is cut asunder at one stroke. It shews also a wound of the Abdomen dilated to thrust in the intestines, which is the next Figure. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Galen. L.</hi> 6. <hi>Meth. Med. cap.</hi> 4. is stitched, namely the Peritonaeum with the muscles, and the muscles again with the Peritonaeum.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. shews the manner how the lips of the wound of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen are brought to touch one the other; and being so brought, are kept so by stitching or clasps. The intestines being put in again, the Assistant shall take hold of the lips of the wound with his hands, and he shall draw forth so great a part of the wound to the Chyrurgian, as is necessary to be stitched; but he sticks in a needle, <hi>(i)</hi> which draws after it a twisted flaxen thread, from the lower and outward parts, <hi>(u)</hi> inwardly through the skin, <hi>(a)</hi> and the muscles <hi>(b)</hi> that lie under it, as far as the Peritonaeum, <hi>(c)</hi> after this the Peritonaeum being not touched <hi>(c)</hi> of this part, he thrusts the needle through the Peritonaeum of the other part, and also through the muscles, from the inward parts to the outward; then taking forth the needle, he ties both ends of the thread, and makes a point; then (z) leaving a space of a fingers breadth, he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:154387:99"/> thrusts the needle through the Abdomen of the same part, from the upward and outward parts (x) inwardly, not touching the Peritonaeum; after that he thrusts the needle through the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum, the muscles, and the skin, from the inward parts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and he makes a point, and so he goes forward, sometimes perforating, sometimes skipping over the Peritonaeum, untill there are made so many stitches as are necessary in sewing the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen. This way of stitching is also to be observed, when the Abdomen, after the Caesarian birth, is to be united with clasps.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. is a truss, or a stay for a Hernia, to be applied to the left groin of people of full growth. The girdle of the truss <hi>(a)</hi> and the under band (b) perforated with many holes, that it may be shut and opened again, it is made of thin leather, or double cotton linnen; the truss (y) is filled with goats hair, that it may be pretty hard, and may hinder the falling forth of the intestines or the caule; let it also have a fastning before, least the under band passing through may waver from it.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. is a truss to be applied to children, and it is made of the same matter that the former is; but it differs in this, because the girdle of this is not to be fastned on the side, nor the under ligature before; but both must be fastned behind, that children may not so easily untie it.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. represents a truss applied to the left groin. All things being put in again that ought to be put in, and a convenient cerat being applied upon the part affected, the target, or cushion, must be stuft with goats hair, or wool, two or three fingers length, and applied; which that it may stick fast, and may not easily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from its place, it is pressed on with a girdle before to the groin, which comes about the loins, and is fastned on at the side, <hi>(a)</hi> and also with the broader under band, (b) (which being behind fastned to the girdle, and drawn downwards, and so coming under the twist is turned up again) passing by the middle of the cushion, and that knitting before, which is therefore joined to the cushion, that the under band may not flag from it, and passing through, it is bound streight to the girdle before.</p>

                  <head>The way to cure a Rupture of the Intestine, very often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by me.</head>
                  <p>THis consists in three things: 1. Putting back again of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine within the Abdomen. 2. By keeping of it so put back, that it may not again, by the groins, fall into the scrotum. 3. By fastning the Peritonaeum relaxed, or healing of it if it be broken. The Chyrurgian who is experienced, shall most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently consider, before he put in the intestine, whether the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be great or small? whether it be new, or fallen to inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? and also whether the intestine be yet lank, or else filled up with some matter?</p>
                  <p>If the rupture be small and new, and the intestine be lank, it will be easily reduced; if the Patient be laid on his back in his bed, with his head somewhat low, and his feet lifted up; for thus the intestines falling to the midriff, they draw after them that which descended to the Scrotum.</p>
                  <p>But if the rupture be great and new, the Chyrurgian must, with his fingers, handle the intestine that is stretched forth with no matter; and he must, by degrees, softly turn it about, the Patients head being first laid somewhat low, so long till by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little it go in again within the Abdomen. And if the Chyrurgian be weary with his hand, he ought to have an able Assistant, well informed in this operation, who may help him, and may likewise handle the intestine.</p>
                  <p>When inflammation is joined with a rupture, which is known by pain, heat, and a Feaver, or winds, the sign whereof are rumbling; and pain extending without any weight; or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are known by not going to stool in two or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>educing the intestine, untill such time as the inflammation is over, the excrements are gone forth and the winds dispersed. This following Cataplasm is proper against the inflammation:
<list>
                        <item>Take Barley meal, one pound.</item>
                        <item>Wheat bran, half a pound.</item>
                        <item>Compleat oil of Roses, three ounces.</item>

                  <p>This being laied hot on the scrotum and groin will very much digest, moderately repells the humours, and most effectually strengthens the parts. If the inflammation be not gone after 24. hours, the Cataplasm must be so often renewed and applied, as shall seem needfull to cure the inflammation. When the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasm is over dried by the vehement heat, and so is hard to come off, we must pour on Wine and Oil hot. Also the place infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with the like good success, is fomented with a hot lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> appoints, made with Beech ashes boiled in it: Take therefore two bundles of raw thread <hi>(which hath not yet lost the digesting quality of it by Fullers washing)</hi> put them into the kettle, and boil them with half a handfull of Cummin-seeds in a sharp lixivium; then take one of the bundles out, and crush it out between two dishes, and lay it broad very hot about the scrotum, as hot as the Patient can suffer it; when it grows luke-warm take it away, and lay on the other; and do this, changing them so often, untill the inflammation be quite gone,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When great pain accompanies the inflammation, then adde to the Cataplasm or fomentation, some, or a great part of Oil of Roses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If with inflammation there be excrements join'd, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intestine from being put back to its place; this is truly a most desperate case, yet <hi>(omitting Purgatives given by the mouth, which else would cause a greater flux of humours to the part affected, and hasten the Patients death, as</hi> Fallopius <hi>testifieth)</hi> we must try to bring forth the excrements with baths or fomentations that loosen distention, and by linitive Clysters cast in in a moderate quantity. In the mean time we must prevent generation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, giving to the sick meats of good juice, and few excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such as are thin flesh broth, rere egs and such like.</p>
                  <p>Also very often winds, without inflammation, fill the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine; in which case there is nothing better than a fomentation that is made of a decoction of a sharp lixivium, with Cummin-seeds and raw thread, and by adding a small quantity of strong Mallage wine to it. The inflammation being cured, and the excrements voided forth, and the winds dispersed, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine be thrust back into its proper place, gently, by little and little, thrusting it in with the fingers.

                  <p>But all these remedies, both outward and inward, will do no good, if there be not a right diet observed; wherefore the sick must avoid all sweet meats, windy, and of ill juice, of which number are all raw herbs, pulse, summer fruits, milk meats, and such like; he must use to eat bread well baked, with Aniseed or Cumminseed in it, he must also feed on dry meats to bind, and clammy to heal; for the first purpose, Thrushes, Blackbirds, and Partridges are good; and for the second, Calves flesh, Gees, and Ducks feet and wings, rather boiled then rosted. His ordinary drink must be Wine, not sweet nor white, but red and astringent, or at least of a taste between both. <hi>But meat and drink taken in small quantity, doth much conduce to the timely recovery of his health.</hi> The sick lying on his back, with both his head and feet raised, must keep his bed at least forty daies, and must take great care of his truss, and must never rise without it, be the time never so short; much less must he go to stool, lest the intestines falling down, should open again that which is newly bound and healed. Also care must be had, that the belly be daily loose, least when the excrements are hard, and are voided by straining, that strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should do very much mischief. To loosen the belly that is too much bound, Prunes of <hi>Ausburg</hi> are very good, if four or five of them be eaten an hour before meals. And it will do no hurt, if once a week the superfluities of the first region be purged forth with Pills of Aloes, prescribed by <hi>Hierom Fabrit. ab Aquap.</hi> the weight of a scruple taken one hour before supper, or by a Clyster cast in in the evening, which if it be made of a decoction loosning and cooling, Hony of Roses, Lenitivum, and Oyl of Chamomil, it will keep the belly loose for many daies after; when forty days are past, the sick may rise; but let him continue his plaister and truss, untill they may be safely taken off. Though none of those that geld men, think that such as have ruptures can ever be cured, without that most dangerous cutting forth of the Testicle, (Table XL. Figure IX, &amp;c.) but that there will be a fear left that it may come again; yet I have cured multitudes,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154387:103"/> whose Sirnames I willingly conceal, in a long time, and with great care by the said remedies; and restored them to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health by using a good Diet, and a good Truss: But such as I could not cure perfectly, by reason of the greatness of the disease, or the long continuance of it; yet I preserved them so, that the disease did not increase upon them.</p>
                  <p>Fig. IX. shews how the urine suppressed is drawn forth by a Catheter; which manual operation is easie to a Physitian that is skilfull; and on the other side hard and dangerous enough to one that is ignorant. <hi>Celsus</hi> describes this <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>C.</hi> 26. but sometimes we are constrained to attempt to bring forth the urine by manual operation, when the sick cannot make water, or else by age the passage of it is fallen down, or because the stone, or some clotted blood are in the way. Also oftentimes a small inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or a Caruncle bred in the urinary passage, will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be made naturally. And this is not only necessary for men, but sometimes also for women; wherefore brazen, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther silver, pipes are made, which they call Catheters; which that they may serve for all great and small bodies, the Physitian must have three ready for men, and two for women. For men the greatest is fifteen inches, the middle size is twelve, and the least nine inches. Of those for women the greatest is nine inches, and the least six. They must be crooked; namely, those for women a little, but for men much more, and they must be all very smooth, and neither too thick nor too thin. Then the Patient must be placed on his back upon a low seat or a bed; and the Physitian, on the right side, with his left hand must hold the man's yard; and with his right hand he must gently thrust into the urinary passage a silver pipe E anointed with oil; and when it comes to the neck of the bladder, he must incline the Catheter with the yard, and so thrust it into the bladder; and when the water is made by it, take it forth again. <hi>Thus far Celsus.</hi> In this manual operation great care must be had, lest in thrusting in of a silver pipe, the fleshy folding be not hurt which shuts the orifices of the seminal vessels, that end about the urinary passage; which is known by the difficulty of thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in, the pain, and blood coming forth. For when these signs appear the Catheter must be drawn back a little, and thrust in again gently, untill, not touching the folding, it go into the bladder, and the urine come forth by it. Others bind to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154387:103"/> the silver wier, that fits the hollow of the pipe, a lock of cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and they thrust it into the cavity of the Catheter, and they force that, with the pipe, into the bladder; when the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes into the bladder, they draw the wier out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, with the wool at the end of it; and so they draw forth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fig. II. shews, besides the way of searching for the stone, the incision of the Perinaeum B, upon the Director C, thrust into the bladder, performed by the pen-knife (Table II. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure II.) Incision being made the Stone-cutter draws out the Directors, and he thrusts in the Catheter by the wound made in the Perinaeum, that the Dilator, or Speculum Vesicae above the pipe, may come into the bladder without any hurt. The Dilator being applied he draws forth the Catheter, he dilates the neck of the bladder, and laying hold of the stone with a fit instrument he pulls it out, &amp;c. Read <hi>Ambros. Paraeus lib.</hi> 17. from chap. 35 to 48. concerning the drawing out of a stone: and that exquisite Treaty of <hi>Guill. Fabrit. Hildan.</hi> of cutting for the stone in the bladder.</p>
               <p>Fig. III. a stone is taken forth of the urinary passage without cutting; because if the stone came out of a more narrow place; namely out of the neck and orifice of the bladder, it will much more easily be taken out of a larger place, as is the conduit of the yard. I take the Probe of <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> which at the end is made hollow like a spoon D, as an ear picker, this I thrust into the passage, so that it may pass beyond the small stone E, and may in a manner comprehend it in its hollow place; then through the pin of the Probe that is hollow, I pour in oil of sweet Almonds into the urinary passage, and I draw the Probe gently to me, for so the stone is by degrees drawn forth; both pressing of it with the fingers, and drawing it with the Probe; see Table XIV. Figure VIII. Also I have often observed such stones that are fallen into the urinary passage, to come forth of themselves, without cutting or help of the spoon; if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient sit frequently in an emollient bath, and take medicaments that are moderate to break the stone, or will suffer them to be dropped into the conduit of the urine.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. doth asswage the heat of urine, which in a virulent Gonorrhaea is so vehement when a man makes water, that the Patients had rather die than make water. When therefore such heat and pain is felt in making water, that it cannot be asswaged by any medicaments taken at the mouth, or poured in, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient shall put a silver most smooth pipe into the passage of the yard, tied by threads (F) which he must hold in his hand,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154387:105"/> least the pipe by force of the urine coming forth, should be driven out again from the urinary passage; but that it may stay fast in, until the urine run forth through it without pain, not so much as touching the conduit of the yard.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. Oftentimes a caruncle is bred in the urinary passage from an ulcer, and it sometimes grows so great, that it stops the water. This is taken away and cured by manual operation, and fit medicaments that have a corroding power; but that no other parts but only the caruncle in the passage may be eaten away, or the water should wash away the medicaments that are applied, <hi>Hierom. Fabrit. ab Aquapend.</hi> invented an instrument, by means whereof nothing but the caruncle is eaten off, and also it hinders that the medicament applied to the caruncle, is not washed away by the water that is frequently made. For a pipe (G) is made of linnen, smeared over with white wax, (in length a fingers breadth, and so broad that it may be equal to the silver Catheter I) which hath a long thread hanging at it. This pipe, first smeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with a convenient medicament, as for example;

The pipe being anointed with one of these medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it must be fitted to the wier H, that comes forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the silver pipe; and together with the silver pipe and wier, it must be thrust into the urinary passage, until it meet with the caruncle; and when it is come to the place of the caruncle, the silver pipe with its wier must be drawn back; but the pipe made of linnen, smeared over with wax and put in, must be left in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154387:105"/> passage, that the urine may come forth by it; and this also hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the medicament applied to the caruncle cannot be washed away by the urine.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. Sometimes it happens that infants are born without any hole in the top of their yard to make water by; this must be presently cured with a sharp knife that hath a narrow point. The sick must be laid on his back, and the yard must be taken hold on near to the glans with the left hand, and with the knife held in the right hand, the hole that is shut must be opened; when this is done, a tent of lead must be thrust into the hole, that is small and solid, and anointed with some healing medicament; which must be taken forth when the sick makes water, and then thrust in again, and this for three or four daies, until the lips of the hole be skinned. But if children be born with a very narrow hole in the glans, that must be presently enlarged by thrusting in a small tent, (made of the pith of Elder, and anointed with unguent of Roses) that it may swell by the moisture it drinks in, and being swoln may enlarge the hole.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. shews pocky excrescences of flesh in the glans and praeputium, and the way to cure them, which is done most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously by binding; for since that these caruncles have a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row basis, they are tied with a single small red coloured silk thread, and they will fall off in two daies; sometimes they are touched most profitably with Oil of Antimony or Logadorum; sometimes they are as well laid hold on with the pullers, and are cut off with a pen-knife; after that the place is cauterized with a very red hot iron, that the blood may not taint the parts near unto it.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV. represent a most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chyrurgery, wherewith at <hi>Nursium,</hi> in my time, the most famous Gelders of Italy did cure Hernias of the Intestines. The sick lies on his back, and is bound upon a table; then the whole dilatation in the groin is marked oblikely with ink; the Assistant, at the bottom of the Abdomen, presses together the Intestines, that they may not come forth; then the Chyrurgian, with a crooked knife, making an oblike incision of the skin, Figure VIII. (that the progress of the Peritonaeum may be seen, Figure IX.) he cuts the Peritonaeum with the same knife, Figure X. and by the hole Figure XI. he forces the Testicle out upwards; after this with his fore finger he pulls away all the membranes, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates them from the Scrotum; and first of all he draws forth the sheath membrane dilated, Figure XII. * and the testicle with it;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154387:106"/> then he laies hold of the spermatick vessels, and the sheath coat, with a convenient pair of pincers, and he fastens them together; then he cuts forth the testicle above the future with a knife, and casts that away; (others tie the spermatick vessels and the coat in two places, and laying hold of the ends of the lower thread, they cut forth the distance with a pair of cizers, and cast away the testicle) but he cauterizes with a red hot iron all the vessels that bleed, and puts them in, leaving a long thread hanging without; and lastly he puts in an iron instrument (L, Figure XIV.) by the hole of the groin, which hath a ball of wax at the point of it, as far as the bottom of the Scrotum, that he may make a hole through it to purge forth the matter, which daily falls into the Scrotum from the wound in the groin; and he keeps the hole open by a tent put into it, untill such time as the wound in the groin be cured.</p>

And if that little skin do alwaies cover the sheath of the matrix, <hi>Paulus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. cuts it with <hi>Celsus</hi> his Spatha, Table II. Figure I.</p>
               <p>Fig. XVII. Teaches how <hi>Hierom. Fabrit. ab Aquapend.</hi> where the lips of the womb cleave together, uses manual operation according to <hi>Paulus:</hi> He laies the woman on her back, (in this manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that of the precedent Figure) so that her legs are drawn up as high as her belly, and her thighs before stradling wide; he also puts her arms under her hams, and binds them to her neck with fit ligature; then with a knife made to cut fistulas, either with a Syringotomus sharp at one end, (Table XIV. Figure I) or with a Woodcocks bill, Table XII. Figure I, II, III, and V. he cuts the lips that grow together, being first marked with ink all the length of them. The lips being parted, and the flux of blood stopt, a leaden pipe is anointed with some healing medicament, and thrust into the matrix, till the cure be perfected, that the lips may not grow together again.</p>
               <p>Fig. XVIII. treats of the matrix falling forth without the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, which thing happens to women, when the membranous ligaments of the womb are either stretched or broken. The cure
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154387:106"/> of this disease requires three things; the placing again of the womb, fallen forth, in its proper place; then to keep it there in its place; and lastly, to knit or consolidate the ligaments.</p>
               <p>Before we repose the womb in its place again, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether the falling forth of the Matrix be single, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not inflammation or a cold humour join'd with it; for when these appear we must not attempt to put it back to its place, untill such time as the diseases be gone.

A fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the decoction of Mallows, Marsh-mallows, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will dissolve a cold tumour. The said tumours being cured, and the belly excrements voided by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and water being made (that the Matrix may be free from all compression) the Chyrurgian, or some experienced Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, must lay the woman on her back, so that her hips may lie higher, and her hams may be bended inward, and her legs may li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This being done the Patient shall fasten the candle with a three double cloath dipped in red wine, and pressed forth again, and with the band, Table XLI. Figure III. for eight or nine daies let her lie with her legs stretched forth and joined close together, so that one may lie upon the other; let her bind an Eagle stone to her arm, and let her put sweet smelling things to her nostrils, unless she be subject to suffocation of the womb.

Also we know exactly the condition of ulcers, by putting a tent into the fundament, and leaving it there an whole day, and then pulling it forth again. The ulcers of the right gut being seen, are most safely cured with a pipe (having a long handle, and perforated on the side, Table XIV. Figure I.) covered with a linnen cloth wet in sharp wine, and pressed forth again, with a hole in it; (for a solid pipe, Table XVI. Figure I. is only smeared with the white of an egg) and thrust into the fundament, it must three or four times receive the iron wier pin made very red hot, Table XVI. Figure IV. and Table XXXVII. Figure I. as we said before for the manual operation of ozaena. The operation being

By this means, without any actual cautery, (which others praise exceedingly to consume hard callous substance in fistulaes) fistulaes that penetrate are most easily and most safely cured.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154387:110"/> for the bottom of the ulcer of the intestine, and when I have found it, by thrusting the probe hard I perforate the skin, (Fig. III.) and I draw it all through the fistula, the silken thread hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down at both holes <hi>(o)</hi> Figure V. when the hollow place is perforated, <hi>Cornel.

                     </gap>ght, and so they cut all the fistula with a thread; yet because the incision and cure of the whole fistula by a thread (Figure V.) proceeds too slowly, and there is continual pain with it, (because every operation ought to be done quickly and sweetly) <hi>Hierom Fabrit. ab Aquapend</hi> deservedly rejects it, and saith there is no place for this way, but only for fearful people who are afraid of the iron instrument, wherefore I do so demean my self. The fistula being perforated with a probe, and with holes (by the help of a silken thread streight twisted with a stick for two daies) for the use of the Syringotomus, (Table XIV, Figure II.) which at one end hath a thicker head sufficiently dilated; I remove the stick <hi>(n)</hi> and the silk, (Figure V.) and cut the fistula after that fashion as I have described it before Fig. I, and II. This latter way of curing fistulaes by a thread and edge of the knife, joins into one the opinions of <hi>Celsus</hi> and the latter Chyrurgians; and by experience, which is a most faithful witness, it is better then simple incision performed by a thread, and more tolerable, but especially when the orifices are too far asunder, by reason of the length of the fistula. If this operation also seem to be too slow, the Chyrurgian shall satisfie all conditions of good operation, if he presently cut the fistula with that knife called Syringotomus, which cuts at that end where it hath a little button besides. I set forth this instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before, Table XIV. Figure I. and I applied it, Table XXIX. Figure III. If such fistulaes grow from outward knots, and such as impostumate, they require the same cure, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I said Figure IV. <hi>Note,</hi> the sphincter muscle, according to <hi>Hippocrates de Haemorrh.</hi> may be safely cut any way, without any hurt done to its functions, if only one eighth part of it be left untouched; otherwise there would follow an excretion of the excrements against a mans will, and at last death it self. Fistulaes in old people, that have run long, are not safely cured, unless an issue be made before they be healed up, three or four fingers above the knees, on the inside, to evacuate the matter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154387:110"/> that is daily collected. The Emrods that require manual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are either external or internal, which first of all the most skilful in Anatomy, <hi>Hierom.

                  <p>These appear at first sight, but those, unless you press the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, and hold your breath, or go to stool, cannot be seen: If they need manual operation, they both do either swell, or run too much.</p>

If they swell much, without pain or inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lie secret, I take the broad iron tool <hi>(p)</hi> (fetched out of the nineteeth Table) and when it is very red hot, I so burn the Emrods, yet not touching them, that is, that they may onely feel the heat of the fire, as the Patient can well endure it: If the Patient, as oftentimes it happens, fear manual operation, with good success also I set on the Leeches prepared, and I draw forth plenty of blood; after that I put up into the fundament <hi>linimentum simplex</hi> with a tent; and I apply a new sponge, wet in black sharp wine, wherein astringents have been boiled, and press it forth again, by this means to corroborate the part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> for the said manual operation, requireth an iron instrument with a round head, such an one as that is, which is lively set forth Table XIX. Figure V. and in the following Figure, letter <hi>q</hi> is the mark for it; with this he drieth them all up, one after another; yet I think, that a broad head is more effectual here, because the operation is sooner ended with this; but that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is best, when either of the Emrods
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154387:111"/> that swel, runs; because this easily passeth by those that bleed; but the broad one dries up all that run with those that are blind, not without great hurt to the Patients; which I would needs warn you of from the observations of <hi>Spigelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Emrods swell so, yet lie so high in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, that they can by no means be seen, and much less be touched by any hot iron be it round or broad. Then if any help be sought for by manual operation, that pipe is necessary to dry them up, which is pictured above Table XVI. Figure III. It is put cold into the fundament, and it is heated with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But the Patient, when he saw death hard by, gave credit to our old Author, and taking me by the hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to me and to the standers by, that he would admit of caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing, since there was no other means left. Whereupon I made hast home and furnished my self with instruments needfull; namely, with pointed instruments (Table XIX. Figure VII, VIII and IX.) and coming back, I delivered them to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of this noble Patient, that he might make them red hot; when they were very red hot, I touched severally the small ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of all the Emrods that bled, and made a hard crust upon them, beginning with the uppermost, lest the blood, running forth of those that were not touched should quench the hot iron. See <hi>Ludovic. septal. l.</hi> 7. <hi>animadver.</hi> 112. very worthy to be read over.</p>
                  <p>The blood being stopped by manual operation, and the best regiment of restoring diet being observed, that noble man was restored to his former health; and I advised him that every three moneths, he should set on four cupping glasses to his shoulders and back, with scarification; that nature might not, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be accustomed to send down the superfluous blood to the Emrod veins. These things being rightly observed, he lived ten years free from any bleeding of the Emrods. But if Nature, before this, had been accustomed to open the veins of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this noble man; and been used to send the superfluous blood thither, I had left one of the Emrods untouched by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, which afterwards should have been stopt with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastick and astringent powders; that it might, either of its own accord, or else by art, be easily opened; and that the blood, daily abounding in the body, which is wont to be evacuated at set times, might be thus purged away, lest those diseases may follow (which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentioneth <hi>sect.</hi> 6. <hi>aph.</hi> 12. he that is cured of the Emrods that have lasted long, unless one of them be left, is in danger of a Dropsie or a Consumption; and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. <hi>text.</hi> 33 and 34.

When I had artificially taken forth the intestines, under the right Hypochondre, there was seen but one Liver only; and on the left side but one Spleen; but in the Reins three Kidneys, and as many Vreters of equal bigness, with their mouths all gaping into one bladder for the urine.

This man, by reason of the pains of his head and limbs in the night, was much suspected by me, and so was carried to the Hospital appointed for those that are sick of the French Pox. He drank the decoction of <hi>Guaicum,</hi> whereby the pains of his head and outward parts ceased, But the Canker, being dressed with topical remedies, did yet pitifully afflict the poor man.

But that which I feared before, when half a year was past, came indeed; namely, a new relapse, a mischief far worse than the former. But I think this relapse is to be imputed unto the Pincers only, whereby I performed the operation; for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument was the most unfit for this operation. <hi>Wherefore if a Canker be run over the whole lip; let the Chyrurgian, taught by mine and</hi> Riedlinus <hi>his errour, take heed that he cut it not off with a pair of Pincers; for it is almost impossible but that it will leave some root behind, from whence the disease will grow up again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember that I have sometimes heard the most excellent <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> give this caution in his publick Lectures, yet I regarded it not, untill such time as I found the experience of it in this Country man and another; that this caution not being observed, the Patients are in danger of their lives, and the Chyrurgian to lose his credit. The sick man being the second time fallen to a relapse before, now comes the third time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire my help in manual operation; and I had performed it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Aquapend.</hi> his direction, with a peece of silver money, having a very sharp edge, and dipt in <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> unless the vessels round about had been so extreamly swoln, that I had cause to think this would be but labour in vain.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:154387:115"/>
               <p>B is the use and application of that Instrument which I described before, Table XVII. Fig. III. and caused the picture of it to be set down. I have found this to be the most useful in wounds, or rather for pricks of the Arteries of the wrist, which easily happen in a duel, for to stop the bleeding, as it shall be made appear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath by a singular observation. Others take silver money, which they binde over the wound; but because that ligature must be very straight, (for if it be too loose it will not stop the flux of blood) by reason of a gangrene ready to fall upon the end of the hand, and sphacelus upon that, (for the vessels are so pressed down, that nourishment and vital and animal spirits cannot come to them) it seemeth to be very dangerous, wherefore I think they would provide better for mens safety, if all Chyrurgians would have such an Instrument in readiness, to use when necessity requireth it. At <hi>Padua,</hi> where the use of Anatomy and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery hath been in great esteem, and flourished for many years, in my time there was a most experienced man to open an Artery, who for the cure of the most bitter pains of the head, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Physitians, oftentimes cut the Artery of the wrist, and making an evacuation of as much blood as he was ordained to do, he pressed the wound so close with the foresaid Instrument, that not one drop of blood could come forth against the will of the Chyrurgian, nor yet any symptome otherwise to be feared followed upon this compression.</p>
               <p>It often hapned at <hi>Vlma,</hi> that by unskilful Quacksalvers, and men not worthy of the name of Chyrurgians, the Artery that accompanieth the vein Basilica, was opened by mistake instead of it, whence oftentimes there was made too great evacuation of blood, or a great <hi>aneurisma,</hi> which ill cured caused death: wherefore if hereafter accidentally any such errour happen, for the remedy of it (besides that remedy the most famous Colledge D. D. <hi>Gregory Horstius</hi> propoundeth in the first of his Chyrurgical Observations, which is most worthy to be read) such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, which by pressing the Artery, will stop the bleeding of it, that it may be applied to the Artery of the arm being hurt, in my opinion would be very convenient. In Helvetia they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily press down the Arteries of the temples, that are broken or cut by chance or by Art, with the convex part of the middle shell of the Walnut.</p>
               <p>C sheweth the application of the iron Instrument (which I took care to be printed before Table XVII. Fig. I. out of <hi>Guil. Fabri. Hild.</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:154387:115"/> his book of burnings) serving to extend the knee contracted. <hi>Iacobus Murdel,</hi> Son to <hi>Iohn Butcher,</hi> being but five years old, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell upon the earth paved with flints, as he ran after his Father, and he walked up and down afterwards, and never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of any pain untill the fourth day after, when he began to halt, and to complain of his knee that was lame; his Mother, careful enough of the boy, sendeth for a Barber, called <hi>Iohan. Andreas,</hi> who presently applied a Cataplasme against bleeding of <hi>Foelix Wurts</hi> his prescription, and the next day (to discuss as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) he applied a three fold linnen cloth wet in hot wine and pressed forth again. The boy thus drest, fell into a most sharp fever, which by convenient remedies rightly prescribed by a Physitian, ended on some critical day, by an Impostume in his foot that was affected, namely an Erysipelas inflammation, which went over all his leg and thigh, also as far as his groin, that vehemently afflicted the childe with heat, redness and pain. The inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being cured, there remained upon the knee that was bruised before the Fever came a huge swelling, which when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted all resolving means, they tried to bring it to suppuration, and they opened the knee both on the outside and inside with a caustick medicament, and no matter, or else very little came forth. The business being thus, the ordinary Physitian departed, and left all the business of the cure to the Barber <hi>And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Mother being now more careful then ever, and finding the good man not sufficient for this cure, and also doubtful, she sent for me to ask my counsel. These things were by relation, but when I came, I found the tumor in his knee not unlike to that which they call <hi>Glidch swam,</hi> and the boy so contracted, that he could not extend his knee. Having made this prognostick, that this disease would be doubtful and of long cure, I began the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness thus: To soften and discuss the tumor, I did daily, for a quarter of an hour, foment the part with a sponge wet in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing decoction.</p>

               <p>wore night and day, every day turning the screw of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument a little, untill the leg was become streight, so that in one year the Patient could walk without a staff. The cause of the contraction was the ill situation of the foot, which they should have prevented with a wooden capsula, which you may see Table XXI. Figure VI.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1636. on the 10. day of <hi>October,</hi> I was called to come to a boy whose name was <hi>Martin Gravius</hi> of <hi>Leishmens,</hi> who shewed me his leg contracted toward the hinder parts, from a ganglion in his knee, which, premising universals, I brought to stand right in eight moneths by the same Instrument, and with topicalls applied.</p>
               <p>D. Table XVIII. Figure V. sheweth the use of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154387:117"/> for as for the extension of the arm, there is nothing better then to carry a heavy stone in a mans hand, so to bend it by degrees; I have found nothing better then this Instrument. The Patient was a Souldier's boy, who had his arm out of joint, and by reason of ill situation he could not bend it; this boy, as I did the others before, I daily anointed, applying the Sparadrap, and I bade him wear the Instrument, and he grew well within two months; and he could for his need bend his arm without any pain or hindrance at all. Wherefore let young Chyrurgians take heed, that they place broken members as they should be placed; for oftentimes, besides the contraction of the part, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will follow an ill figure. See Table XXVI.</p>
               <p>E. <hi>An.</hi> 1626. on the 19. day of <hi>November,</hi> my brother <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> called me to his father in law, <hi>Iohn Wolventer,</hi> a Mariner of <hi>Vlma,</hi> and most skilful to sail in the <hi>Danow:</hi> This very man, whom my most famous Colleague, D. D. <hi>Greg. Horstius,</hi> cured in his Chyrurgical Observations IX. shewed unto me a Fistula in his left thigh, (which from a contusion was brought to suppuration, and being care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esly dressed, came to this pass) and asked help from me. I trying the bigness of the Fistula with my probe, found it to be only superfic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al, and long and broad enough: But because these sloping Fistulaes are very seldom made to solder to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as it is well known, the next day I attempted to cut it with the cizers called <hi>Deceptoria,</hi> spoken of before Table VII. Figure IX. (not being at that time skilled in the Instruments ca led <hi>Syringotomi,</hi> described Table XII. Fig. I, II, III. and Table XIV. Figure I.) when the Patient was not aware of it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fill it up with flesh afterwards: But when that operation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded too slowly by the cizers, the Mariner, perceiving the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, removed his thigh, and with his hand thrust off my right hand; whereupon, laying aside the cure by this Instrument, I bound up the Fistula, a little dilated (as you may see in the Figure) with the white of an Egg beaten, and some carded flax; when the blood was sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ped, every third or fourth daies I syringed it with Hydromel to wash the cavity; and on the fifth, sixth and seventh daies, I injected sharp black Wine wherein Flowers of wilde Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates were boiled, and Pomegranate pills, &amp;c. and I bound on a new sponge wet in the same liquor, and pressed forth again, with a long roller that was three fingers broad (for a broader will not bin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it so well;) I began my ligature from beneath, on the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154387:117"/> lower parts, and I ended it above the Fistula on the sound part; with these medicaments, that have an huge glewing quality, and the mnaner of ligature, my Brother's Father in law was most luckily cured in one week: And from that time I never used any manual operation, unless medicaments to cure were used first in vain; and never after that time did I use those deceitful cizers, called <hi>Deceptoria,</hi> because they deceive the Chyrurgian and not the Patient.</p>
               <p>F sheweth the place for Issues on the arm. Fontanels are made in divers places, but those that are made by caustick on the arms are the best, and seem to be most convenient; and therefore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians make choise of them before the other, namely to make evacuation of all those humours which may offend mans head; because these have the middle place exactly between the parts above and the parts below, and they hinder the rising up of the humours unto the head; and they most commodiously make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion of them, and derive them that are flown up to the head, by reason of their convenient distance: and they do not onely help much for the diseases of the head, eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, jaws and throat, but also for the diseases of the thorax, heart and lungs. And though these Issues for the said diseases do help much, and are most commodious for the sick, and that the rather, because they can look to them, and dress them with their own hands; yet there are multitudes of men who condemn all Issues, despising their own healths, because these Issues require care and labour; others hate them because they stink; and some are afraid to have them burned, because they fear the fire. I answer these men, that they cannot put off and on their clothes evening and morning without labour and care, nor can they void their excrements without stink; but as this or that is necessary for mans life, so are Issues for some people to live in health, and enjoy their lives most needful: And as no man repenteth his labour to put off and on his clothes, so no man complaineth of these Issues, but taketh great pleasure to dress them, either from the delight they finde when they itch, or because from day to day they clearly see the evacuation of the matter, which was bred by errours committed, and being kept in the body would produce much hurt; or rather because hereby men regain their healths which they had lost: and therefore oftentimes men are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one Issue, but will have two or three, or more made,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:154387:118"/> as they finde cause. Add to this, that Fontanels, if they be guided by Art, do not stink, and made in a convenient place will cause no pain.</p>
               <p>The place for Issues requireth four conditions. First, That the Patient can see it. Secondly, That it be sit for ligature. Thirdly, That it may have a vein. Fourthly, That it be made between two muscles, to prevent pain, wherewith motion is easily hindred.</p>
               <p>This place is easily found, if the Chyrurgian doth variously turn and bend, and extend the Patient's arm, untill he finde the due separation of the muscle Deltoides and Biceps: Many make the Issue upon the Deltoides it self, some at the end of it, others on the upper part of it; but I, for the said conditions, make choice of the place marked with the letter F; namely, the distance between the muscles Deltoides and Biceps; and that rather on the upper part, which is less sensible, then on the lower part, and the humour runs in short time to it.</p>
               <p>Having found the place for the Issue, the way must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered on; for a Fontanel is made with a lancet, a potential or an actual cautery: But since a red hot iron is most usual with the Inventours of this manuall operation, I do not like potentiall cauteries, because they work slowly, and oftentimes with great pain; nor are they so safe, because we do not exactly know their force in working; but sometimes, besides our expectation, we finde them weaker or stronger then we imagined. Also I refuse a cutting Instrument, or lancet, for the reasons now alledged; to which I add, that cutting of an Issue will make it bleed, and many cannot endure to see their own blood. The Antients, with great dexterity, used the red hot iron which was crooked, and had a long handle, (described Table I. Figure I.) But when they found that that Instrument did not only burn the flesh, marked before by the Chyrurgian, but also heated the parts that are near to it, they invented another Instrument besides this, that had a pipe to it that defended the parts adjoining, see Table I. Figure I. through this pipe, not heated, and thrust hard upon the skin, they thrust in a solid red hot iron, that it may enter as far as the Chyrurgian will have it, sometimes deeper, sometimes not so deep. <hi>Iulius Casserius Placentinus</hi> invented an Instrument described
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:154387:118"/> before Table I. and here it is marked with the Letter G, which hides the fire, and defends the parts near adjoining from being hurt: <hi>And above all other instruments to burn fontanels, that are without the head, it is the most convenient, and the most safe.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six hundred Patients will testifie that I have done this to them, to the admiration of the standers by, and to the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Patient; and so many are now alive who have issues of my making.</p>
               <p>H is the ligature to bind upon the issues of the Arm; it is most commodious, because it is easily put on by the Patient; most profitable, because it preserves the issue in its place; and it is most fair, because being made of white linnen, it may be washed; neither is this like other bands so easily seen or felt.</p>
               <p>I is the place for issues in the Thigh (which must be sought for four fingers breadth above the knee, between the muscle <hi>Sartorius</hi> and <hi>Vastus Internus</hi>) most fit for ligature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vein <hi>Saphena</hi> joins to it, where an issue is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably made for hysterical passions, to make revulsion and derivation. I have cured Women this way, whose names I conceal, who by the stopping of their Courses, were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with <hi>Furor uterinus</hi> and other symptoms; and more that had ulcers upon their shins hard to be cured; there by revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but here by intercepting and deriving.</p>
               <p>K is an instrument that I made most happily, about the beginning of the muscle <hi>Gastrocnemius,</hi> against the pain of the hip. Truly the most excellent Physitian <hi>Adrian Spigelius, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. in <hi>Human. Corp. Pabric.</hi> commendeth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an issue, in the Calf of the Leg, with an actual cautery, by reason of the passage of the Ham vein; or for the meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the beginnings of the muscle <hi>Gasterocnemius;</hi> which <hi>Daniel Bucretius,</hi> upon <hi>Iulius Casserius Placeutinus</hi> his Anatomical Tables (which I bought, with <hi>Spigelius</hi> his money, from the heirs of <hi>Casserius</hi>) marked <hi>L.</hi> 1, Table 2. with the Greek letter π. But because that place, by reason of its sloping downwards, is very inconvenient to bind; I, according to <hi>Andreas Vesalius</hi> in <hi>Corp. Human. Fabric. Lib.</hi> 2. Table 10.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154387:119"/>
                  <hi>De Musculis,</hi> chose a place somewhat higher, and that not without good reason. For an issue in this place hath all the conditions of a good issue that I speak of before. 1. The Ham vein, which both the Antients and latter Chyrurgians, with very good success opened for pains of the hip; and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more diseases which <hi>Aurelius Severinus</hi> hath collected <hi>Lib. de Angeologia, Cap.</hi> 26. 2. Here is the distance between the beginnings of the muscle of the Calf of the Leg; for that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nerve, that runs under the knee, is not in danger to be hurt; for where the issue is made, that nerve going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hath already crept deeper, that it cannot be offended with a red hot iron. 3. For the Ligature that standeth fast. 4. The Patient himself can govern and dress it when he pleases. It is a most certain thing that he who is troubled with pains of the hip, cannot easily be freed from them; that he can promise, that for the future, he shall never be troubled with those pains any more. Yet I can rightly say, that after the use of the Bath at <hi>Thalfengens,</hi> commonly called <hi>Sosunbrun,</hi> lying in the Country of <hi>Vlma,</hi> by help of this issue, I cured myself, for nine years, from this pain; and may be longer, if it please God I live, taking my farewell from all opening of the hip vein, and all purgatives and sweating medicaments, and from all topicals, which I used, for a whole year, by the advice and prescription of the most famous Physitians. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if hereafter, for such continued pains of the hip; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward remedies be used to no purpose: by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel let men flie to this manual operation, with good hope of recovery, as unto a sacred anchor; namely, to burn a fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanel in the place marked, for I doubt not but the Patient will have his health, and the Chyrurgian shall obtain great praise by it.</p>
               <p>L is the Band for issues in the Thigh and Calf to be bound with; and it is the best of all bands. How fontanels made should be kept and rightly ordered, we might learn out of that leaf of <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> where he speaks of it, in his work of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual operations, under the Title of Fontanels; unless that by the carelessenesse of the Printer, to whom the Authour delivered the sheet to print, it had been lost: Wherefore, this being wanting, let men read that most elegant Treatise, which <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.

               <p>N sheweth the use of the said Pincers, and the way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, which is this: Pull forth the wimble, and let down the outward pipe toward the spoons, so that the Instrument may be shut, and may resemble the form of an Instrument, printed Table XIV. Figure XI. This being done, the outward pipe must be anointed with Oil of Roses, and the Instrument must be gentlie thrust into the wound with the Chyrurgians right hand, untill such time as the toothed end of the spoons lay hold of the bullet; then the Chyrurgian shall hold the Instrument between his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger and thumb of his left hand, and with that he shall presse against the bullet as hard as the Patient can endure it, that it may not fall off from the Pincers; after this, with the fingers of his right hand, he shall put in the Piercer by the hole of the round cover, so far as to the bullet, and he shall turn that about, and by degrees fasten it in the bullet: But so soon as the Chyrurgian knoweth that the Piercer sticketh fast in the bullet, he shall by little and little draw up the outward pipe, and shall presentlie put it down again, that the spoons opening may take in the bullet, and by holding it fast when it is in, may help the Piercer to bring it forth. These things being rightlie performed, the Piercer and both Pipes, and the whole Instrument, with the bullet stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and received in, must be drawn out by the way the Figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth unto you.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> that many make mention of and commend the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whose Figures you find pictured before Table XV by which, if the bullet falleth off, a nerve, vein or arterie is easilie hurt; wherefore they that have not at hand those two Instruments, Table XIV. Figure X, XI. (which for above twenty two years, during the German wars, I happily used in curing many Souldiers) shall do excellently well, who for other Pincers use the right Cranes bill, Table XI.

                  <hi>Marsin Schmidt</hi> of <hi>Oellingen,</hi> a boy of eleven years of age, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a most vehement pain in his right shin bone, and that by two holes the stinking matter ran forth; one of these was about the inward ankle-bone▪ and the other about the out ward ankle-bone. This sore was dressed by the ordinary Barber of that Village, for a dislocation of the foot. In the year 1640. upon the 16. day of <hi>December,</hi> the sick boy was taken into the Hospital at <hi>Vlma;</hi> and I, at the command of the famous Senate, did visit him; and I presently found, that this infirmity was no dislocation, but the corruption and eating away of all his shin-bone, which I intended to cure. The first day therefore I prescribed him a good regiment of diet, and this following potion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Take Syrup of Roses solutive, one ounce and a half.</item>
                  <item>Electuary Linitivum, six drams.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Mingle all for a small potion.</p>
               <p>By this he had five stools of very watry matter. On the 22. of <hi>December</hi> I cut his leg with an incision knife, from the head of the shin-bone as far as the inward ankle-bone, doing no hurt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:154387:121"/> to any vein, artery, nerve or tendon; and with the nails of my fingers I separated the Periostium from the bone; and I bound up the wound with Hemp hards, spread with an astringent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, made of the white of an Egg beaten with Rose-water, and the astringent Powder of <hi>Galen,</hi> and with a band having two ends. On the 23 day, when the blood was stopt, I unbound the wound, and looked into it, and I saw that my judgement did not fail me in it; for not only the fore part of the shin-bone was corrupted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but the hinder part was corrupted as far as the marrow of it; and after that I presently took forth some pieces of the shin-bone corrupted with my pullers, and I bound up again the wound with my medicament and ligature, by reason of the vehement crying out of the Patient. On the 24. day I scraped the corrupted bone with my scraping Instruments, and I found the lower end of the shin-bone very much corrupted and stinking: wherefore I purged the shin-bone with Decoctum Divinum, and I strewed upon it the Powder of Birthwort, and Orris Florentine, and I bound up the wound covered with Ceratum Diapalma. On the 25. and 26. daies, I scraped the bone by reason of the great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and I drew forth with my pullers many pieces of the rotten bone. On the 29. day, I cut off with my cizers, Table XX. Figure I, from the lower and inward end of the shin-bone, a great part that was rotten. On the 30. day, the stink of the bone did somewhat abate, by the using of Decoctum Divinum, On the 31. day, after that the pain of the foot and stink was abated, I fed the Patient with glewing diet, to breed a callous; and I laid upon the wound Ceratum Divinum to bring it to cicatrize. From this time, untill the 4. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> of the year 1641. from the lower end of the shin-bone, or external ankle-bone, rotten matter ran forth. On the 6. day there appeared solid flesh about this hole. On the 7. day the wound was handsome; and Nature wholly separated the shin-bone from the lower part unto the middle of it, where it was rotten; when the bone was separated, the wound grew well in a moneths time.</p>

                  <p>But if for all the use of this remedy, they continually ake, and are not discussed, it is a most certain sign that the bone under the knot is corrupted, and therefore it is necessary to make incision upon the node, along the shin bone, with an incision knife, Table II. Figure II. and the bone being uncovered, must be scraped away with scraping tools where it is corrupted. Such knots as they seldom happen in <hi>Germany,</hi> so the manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the cure of them is not admitted, but to those only that desire it in their most bitter torments: But in <hi>Italy</hi> most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and happily, men are cured by manual operation: Wherefore though I had many, both noble and ordinary people, under my hands to cure, who were tormented with nodes of the French Pox, yet I was suffered to use manual operation upon very few of them. But because at <hi>Padua</hi> I have seen this operation so often, where multitudes are alwaies complaining of pains in their shin bones, there I often used it; and I would needs insert, very briefly, into this work of ours, the way used by those of <hi>Padua</hi> in performing this operation, that Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Chyrurgery (for whose sake I write this) may know how speedily to help their Patients that earnestly desire manual operation from them, when there is no remedy almost left. The first day they cut the venerious node, with the knife men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, upon the length of the shin bone, unto the bone it self; then they dilate the wound with hempen hards, wet in the white of an Egg beaten; and they swath the leg about with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ligature, to keep off a flux of humours: On the second day they take off the hards, and lifting up the wound artificially, having first very well defended the sound parts about it that they may take no hurt, they fill it with a caustick (I could rather wish it were with that which <hi>Ambros: Paraeus</hi> describeth by the name of <hi>Holosericum Lib.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.) After this they cover it with a plaister extended all the breadth of it, but not going round about the leg; and they bind the leg again, with a pressing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:154387:122"/> band, according to Art. On the third day removing all these, they apply things to make the Eschar fall off; when that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away they scrape away the rottenness unto the quick; and then with drying powders they cover the bone with flesh. They first cut the node, that the caustick may sooner come to act; yet incision is not alwaies necessary, unless it be for those who will hardly beleeve the Chyrurgian when he tells them that the bone is rotten, untill such time as they see it or touch it themselves.</p>
                  <p>S represents the Curashier ligature, which borrows the name from the similitude it hath to a Roman breast plate; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for those who must have a band, near the throat, upon the broad shoulder bone, breast, back or sides. But a swath with one end is thus rolled about: First it is put under the arm pit (<hi>Galen l. de Fasciis</hi> 79.) then it is brought slanting over the breast, near that place where the throat is joined with the breast bone; then by the hinder part of the neck, to the broad shoulder bone of the opposite shoulder; and so to the arm-pit under that; and from that to the hinder part of the neck that is above the part; where the band was first laid on, so that near the hinder part of the neck, there may be made a cross like to the letter X. after this it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a slant to the broad shoulder bone on the other side, and to the arm-pit; and from the arm-pit, to the hinder part of the neck, and upon the vertebra of the neck, it may represent the letter X; then again it is brought under the arm-pit, and slantingly near to the part where the throat joins with the breast bone; so that here also there must be made the likeness of the letter X; and near the hinder part of the neck, and above the broad shoulder bone, and under the arm-pit, that it may represent the letter X four times; namely once before, once behind and twice near the throat. And by the same reason it is brought about as oft as need is; then it is wound round about the breast and the sides so, that the whole li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature represents a breast plate.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION I.</hi> Of a wound in the Head with a depression and large Fissure of the Skull.</head>
               <p>IN the Year, 1637. The 9th. of <hi>January,</hi> about seven at night, <hi>John Happel</hi> of the City of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> a Quartermaster. Being of a hot and moist temperament of body, and in the two and thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of his age, was wounded in a Duel, by a Trumpeter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving seven wounds, one of which was upon the outward part of the Radius of the left arm near the wrist: the other six in his head; the first of which was behind his left ear, the second about the Coronal Suture, the third near to the Sagittal Suture, the fourth and fifth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fore-head cross-wise. These were all superficial, or in the Skin, or at least made only with the edge or point of the sword; but the sixth was in the temporal Muscle of the right-side and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for the sword being turned backward, the wound was made by the hilt, the lesser part of the Pommell driven in, and the Skull or Cranium hereby fractured and depressed. A Chyrurgeon of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:154387:123"/> City dressed these wounds after the same manner as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wounds use to be.</p>
               <p>Upon the tenth by the command of the Consul, I visited him, and made slight of all these wounds, except that in the temporal Muscle; neither was I deceived in my opinion: for I found the Skull to be depressed with the broad bended probe described (Tab. IX. Fig. VI.) whereupon I presently put a piece of new Spunge twisted about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wound, that it might be dilated; I sprinkled the powder of Orris, or Flower-de-Luce of Florence, and Birthwort upon the bone, I applied a Digestive to the lips, and upon that Diapalma, and a convenient Cataplafme.</p>
               <p>Those wounds about the Coronal and Sagittal Suture, I did also somewhat dilate, putting in Lint with a Digestive, and a Searcloth of Diapalma over it; I made use of that Bandage, or rowler described, Tab. XXXI Fig. IX, X. The other I dressed as simple wounds; as to his dyet, his meat was Panado, decocted Barley, and Damask Pruans: his drink this following Magistral Barley-water.</p>

               <p>Mixing them according to Art, and let them be made into a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Glyster, whereby the Patient may not be too much disturbed.</p>
               <p>Upon the twelfth day at ten in the morning, by reason of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet night, and a greater swelling and pain about the wound. I declared to the Patient and the standers by, that it was necessary to dilate the wound in the temporal Muscle with an Incision Knife, and the wound being bound up again as before, I prescribed to the Patient by reason of a bitterness in his mouth this following Syrup to purge Choler.</p>
               <p>Take of

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This gave him five stools of a bilious matter.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth day he was somewhat better then the day before, and I bound up the wound the same way as formerly.</p>
               <p>Upon the fourteenth day the Patient complained of a great pain in the wound of the temporal Muscle, and therefore together with the Chyrurgion who was called at the first, we determined to dilate the wound with an Incision Knife according to the length of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the temporal Muscle, in form of a Triangle, or the letter V. Tab. XXXI. Fig. XI. that the Skull near to its depression might be more conveniently penetrated by the Trepan, and be raised up by the putting in of the Levator, Tab. XXXII.</p>
               <p>Upon the 15. and 16. by reason of the painfulness of the wound and the new Moon I bound up the wound as before.</p>
               <p>The seventeenth, for the pain which the matter caused which found no way to get out, (for the wound was too narrow) he made use of his Lenitive Glyster.</p>
               <p>The 18th day the Patient having had an unquiet night, I dilated the wound of the temporal Muscle in the form of the letter V. with a streight Incision Knife, Tab. II. Fig- XI. I separated the Pericranium from the bone with my nails, I filled up the cavity with Balls of Hemp hardes moystned with the whites of Eggs stirred up together, and sprinkled over with an astringent pouder, I anointed the parts about it with Oyl of Roses, and put on a Bolster of Linnen dipped in red Wine and pressed out, and also the rowler or bandage before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth day the blood being quite stopped after the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               <p>On the twenty first, both the Wound and the Patient were better, and he confessed that he had slept all night, therefore I applyed again to the thicker Membrane red Silk dipped in Oyl of Roses, and fastned to a thread; to the Skull, Pouder of Round Birthwort and Flower-de-Luce of Florence, to the lips this digestive.</p>
               <p>Rozin of Turpentine washed in Betony-water two drams and a half, and the yolk of an Egg; adding over it Diapalma and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplasm.</p>
               <p>From the twenty second to the twenty sixth, the Patient went on well as to his wound.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty seventh, I cut out four pieces of the Skull pressed down, which yeilded not to the Levators delineated in <hi>Tab.</hi> XI. but with a new Instrument <hi>Tab.</hi> IV. <hi>Fig.</hi> XI. and applyed to the thick Membrane by reason of some corruption, the Silk dipped in a Liniment, which consisteth of Syrrup of red Roses, and some drops of Spirits of Wine, and Turpentine, eating away the fleshy excrescense with Pouder of burnt-Allum.</p>
               <p>On the twenty ninth for the purging away serous and bilious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, with which his body abounded, I prescribed this following Infusion.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1638. on the 15. of <hi>October,</hi> by the command of the Consul, I went into the house of <hi>John Jacob Hecking,</hi> Citizen and Tayler of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> whom I found in bed, afflicted with four Wounds on the head; of which, one was in the Synciput, or fore part of the head, on the left side, with a great inflammation of the Pericranium, which tended to Corruption, and a fracture of the Skull: the other three were simple wounds: all these were presently dressed by a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as simple Wounds use to be. Upon the 16. (which was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day from the hurt) by reason of the great putrefaction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Pericranium, and the Fissure of the Skull; of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of which, we were yet uncertain. I dilated the Wound in the Synciput with an Incision-knife, in the form of a Cross. <hi>Tab.</hi> XXX. <hi>Fig.</hi> IX. and bound it up with Astringent Medicines. The third day, the bloud being stopped, I scraped the Fissure of the Skull with my paring Instruments. <hi>Tab.</hi> XXX. <hi>Fig.</hi> X. On the tenth, I scraped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chink, or crack still deeper, and yet the mark of the ink made with a pen upon the Fissure remained, which with no sort of paring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments could be taken out. In the mean time, by reason of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, and of the flux of humours to his breast; I prescribed this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:154387:125"/> gentle Potion, that the humours might not be stirred too much.</p>

               <p>With this he voided seven times bilious matter. On the fifth day looking upon the wound, and the Patient holding his breath, a kind of serous matter, with some drops of blood, flowed out at the fissure, which was deeply scraped down with the paring Irons. Things being thus; I called to mind the Golden words of our Old Man, in his book of Wounds, <hi>Text</hi> 22. who saith, <hi>Where the Cleft goeth deep in, nor can be taken out by scraping, is this case, you must proceed to the cutting, or perforating of the Skull.</hi> And <hi>Text.</hi> 28 <hi>When any one understanding a Bone to be cleft, broken, or bruised; and through Errour hath not sawed it away, and perforated it,</hi> &amp;c. Amongst the more Modern Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, and Chyrurgions, <hi>Hieronym, Fabrit. ab Aguapend.</hi> and his Master <hi>Fallopius,</hi> do judge, that those great and cruel Symptoms are not to he expected; which our Barbers with so much danger to their miserable Patient, do often very imprudently wait for. <hi>Fallopius</hi> is not solicitous for contusions made on the outward table of the Skull; but declareth, <hi>That those which reach to the middle, can by no means be without danger: by reason that corrupt bloud may there be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which descending upon the thicker Membrane of the brain, may corrode it.</hi> For these Reasons therefore, upon the sixth day I made a hole through the Skull with a Trepan, neer the Fiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>IN the Year 1626. on the 11th of <hi>October, George Seitz.</hi> in the Village of <hi>Edelhaussen,</hi> being about forty years of age, received a great Wound, in the night time, upon the fore-part of his head; and happening presently upon an Empirick, who not observing the penetration, or Fissure of the Skull; strove to heal up the Wound, with Sarcotick Medicines, after his fashion. But the Symptoms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing daily, by the persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sion of his Friends, he comes to <hi>Ʋlme:</hi> and on the twentieth of <hi>October</hi> sends for me, and for my most eminent
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:154387:127"/> Collegue, <hi>D. Johannes Scultetus,</hi> a person well versed in Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Operations. Considering therefore of the Circumstances, we were afraid of some foul matter under this fair appearance; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forcing open the Wound, we found the Skull divided through both the Tables, and under it a corrupted matter gathered together; which, upon stopping the mouth, and blowing through the nose, issued forth. Having made our prognostick, we declared it necessary to apply the Trepan; encouraging the Patient, seeing he was yet strong enough to admit it. On the 21. of <hi>October,</hi> being purged the day before with Lenitive Electuary, we ordered the skin to be divided according to the tendency of the fibres of the Muscle of the forehead, or eye-brows; not cross-wise, as it useth to be, lest by such a division the fibres of the foresaid Muscle being hurt, the upper eye-lid might fall down, as I had observed it on the seventh of <hi>March,</hi> 1614. upon a fall from a high place▪ whereby this Muscle, in a certain womans forehead, was bruised. Making therefore a sufficient incision, the skin was separated from the Skull with the fingers, and the Wound bound up with Lint sprinkled with an Astringent Pouder, and moistned a little outwardly with the white of an Egg. On the 22. the bloud being stopped▪ the Trepan, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXI. <hi>Fig.</hi> V. was applyed by my Collegue. The Dura Mater appeared also somewhat hurt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, thin corrupted bloud boyling out at a little hole of it: we endeavoured therefore daily to help the inflammation, and to wipe away the corrupted bloud, not neglecting, in the mean time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gentle evacuations; as also, the ordinary spare Diet; by which means he was perfectly recovered after a fortnight, or three weeks, enjoying his health now this three years, as well as before. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest therefore, that the use of the Trepan may be admitted, not only in the beginning, but in the progress of a Disease, if the Patient be not too weak.</p>

               <p>On the twentieth day, two hours before noon, he complained of a very great pain of the Head; the bandage being taken off, and the Wound uncovered, and looked into, I diligently searched out the breadth and depth of the Wound, with the round end of the Probe, and found the Skull to be very much depressed.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the same day I opened the Wound in the Figure of the Letter X or a Cross with <hi>Celsus</hi> his Spatha, or Incision Knife sharp on both sides. <hi>Tab.</hi> XI. <hi>Fig.</hi> I. and the Membrane being separated from the Skull with the Nails; for the stopping of the blood, and keeping the Wound open, I applyed a stupe of Hemp-hards moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the white of an Egg, beaten up, and sprinkled with the Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Pouder; and for hindring the inflammation, I anointed the whole Head and Neck with Oyl of Roses, and a Bolster of Linnen four times doubled I bound to the Wound with the Rowler, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXI. <hi>Fig.</hi> X. at Night he drank the cooling Syrup, and made use of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-water for his Drink, and Panado for his Supper.</p>
               <p>On the 21. at ten of the Clock before noon, the bloud being stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I took off the Rowler, and removed what was to be removed; then looked into the Wound, and found not only a depeession in the bone of the Synciput, at the distance of a thums breadth from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronal

The former of which, reached from the depression to the right eye, passing through the Coronal Suture; and the latter reached to the left ear. Things being so confused, I applyed the Pouder of round Birthwort and Orris to the bone; to the lips, a digestive Oyntment, and over it Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma: and for the great Tumour of the right eye, I ordered the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cataplasm.</p>

On the 23. the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being greater; as also the pain, giddiness, and swelling of the right eye: I was forced to perforate the Skull with the Trepan, n'er to the Coronal and Sagittal Sutures; and being perforated, I made the rough parts of the hole smooth with the Lenticular Instrument; and putting under the Levatorie, I reduced the depressed bone, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXII. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. I put a piece of Silk dipped in the Oyl of Roses upon the Dura Mater, tied fast to a string; the rest of the Wound I bound up with the Pouder and dry Lint, a Digestive, Diapalma, and the Cataplasm; not neglecting to anoint the neck, and the parts neer the wound. In the evening the Patient was better than in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the Skull was perforated; and he made use of his cooling Syrup. On the 24. at ten in the morning, the Patient being better than he had been the foregoing days: for cooling him, and for revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Median Vein of the right Arm was opened, and four ounces of bloud taken away. On the 25. the pain being appeased, he took a Potion, to relieve him from being bound, which is very hurtful in Wounds of the head.</p>

               <p>The Wound, and right Eye pleased me well: the Patient took his cooling Syrup at night. On the 26. he said that he had slept very quietly the whole night, and found no pain of his head or right Eye. On the 27. he rested quietly again, and found no trouble from the Wound: some drops of a serous matter flowed out at the thicker Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Brain: for the better drying it up, I applyed a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Syrup of Roses, Turpentine, and Spirit of Wine upon a peice of Silk, with the Cataplasm; instead of Oxymel Simplex, I mingled rough Red-wine, the better to strengthen the head. On the 28. the Patient was as well as the day before; but I perceived the Membrane of the Brain to be black on the outside, by reason of the Contusion. On the 29. being bound, he took his Laxative Potion, which gave him three stools: the Liniment had caused the Membrane to tend to Suppuration, and after the wiping away of the black spot with Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a small effusion of bloud it appeared red. On the 30. he seemed to be very well; but complained of a beating pain about the forehead, and temporal Muscle. On the 2. of <hi>December</hi> the pain ceased of it self, and the Patient thought himself strong enough to walk without a staff. The purulent matter which flowed from the Dura Mater, through the hole made with the Trepan, was white, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. Instead of the Liniment and Digestive, I applyed to the fleshy Membrane and lips of the Wound, Oyntment of Betony mixed with the yellow Cerate.</p>

On the 5. the Dura Mater was covered over with red flesh, which <hi>Celsus</hi> accounteth a very good sign, who in his eighth book writeth, <hi>That when all goeth well, the flesh beginneth to grow from the Membrane it self.</hi> On the 7. day, for the farther drying it, I applyed the Ceratum Divinum to the Dura Mater. On the 8. 9, and 10. the Patient continued well. On the 11. he slept not at all. On the 12. he complained of pain of his head. On the 13. he slept a little. On the 16. with my Brode somewhat bended, I came between the first and second Table of the Skull; and separating a part of the bone with the Lenticular Instrument, I drew it out with the Pincers: I took another bone skaled off from the forehead with the toothed Pincers. The 19, 20, 21, and 22. he continued well. On the 23. he complained of a pain on his forehead, with a heaviness, for which he took the former Potion, which wrought five times: But drinking cold water plentifully after dinner, he complained of a pain in his stomach. On Christmass day eating much flesh meat, there came a new flood of humours upon the Wound; he was feaverish all over, and the flesh appeared black in the Wound: therefore forbidding him flesh-meat, I allowed him only Panado. I purg'd him gently, kept him to a slender diet, and took off the black excrescence of flesh with Burnt-Alum; and in the space of five days he was better. In the Month of <hi>January</hi> I Cicatrized the Wound with the Ceratum Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and restored him to his former health with the forementionad Remedies.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION VII.</hi> Of a Contusion of the head, causing Death an hundred days after, by omitting the use of the Trepan.</head>
               <p>A Country fellow, very strong, and who had never been sick in his life; about forty years of age fighting with others at Fifty-cuffs, sustained a great number of violent blows upon his bare head: this was done on the 11th of <hi>November,</hi> 1630. he did not much regard this; and for some days went about his ordinary imployment, although he felt no small pain. Upon the 18th day he began to be weaker, and to feel his pains more violent; the motion of lower Jaw was so difficult that he could scarce open his mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, or put in meat; and at length, without pressing the Jaw down with his hand he could not at all. A Country Barber being sent for, began to cure him with I cannot tell what Remedies; but all things growing worse, an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chyrurgion was called after four days: <hi>viz.</hi> upon the 22d of the same month, from one of the Neighbouring Towns. He applyed divers outward discussing Remedies, and did somewhat mitigate, but not remove the pains: which did more and more settle themselves all over the head, and back-part of the neck, and grew so violent, that he could neither move his head, nor lift up his eyes; besides these, giddiness, want of sleep, sometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aving, and the weakness of all parts did so afflict him, that he could sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce stand upon his feet, much less walk, and sometimes not so much as lift up his hands to his head.</p>
               <p>At last a Physitian was sent for upon the 7th day of <hi>December;</hi> who seeing him taken out of his bed, placed in a chair, and looking so grimly, was not a little surprised, and feared that Convulsions, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more dangerous Symptoms might presently happen. In the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther search and examination for the discovery of the Signs, and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of his Disease, he felt about his head, that he might know in what part it most pained him; and found a softness on the upper, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of his head, which gave way to his fingers, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent pit remained in his skin; and therefore judged that there was an
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:154387:132"/> Effusion, and gathering together of congealed putrid bloud under the Musculous coat, which ought to be evacuated by laying open the skin, least the bone of the Skull migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be corrupted thereby, the Pericranium inflamed, the forementioned Symptoms increased, and Death it self succeed.</p>
               <p>This was performed by a Chyrurgion then present, and the skin cut cross-wise with a Rasor, the Incision being made down to the Pericranium, black bloud congealed, and some water, flowed out. By this opening of the skin, the Symptoms were in some measure mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, and much of the pains of the head remitted. Concerning this, others, especially (those who had done him this injury) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak ill, and as if the Incision had not been necessary, and that it had done the head much hurt: at which, the Physitian some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moved, who knew him to be in no small danger, by the severity of the Symptoms, suspected also that there might be a Fissure of the Skull made by the blows, (for he could not be well assured whither they had not made use of Weapons, and Clubs, as well as their Fists.) or that the blood collecled together under the skin, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Skull; or that an inflamation rising in the outward parts neer the Sagittal Suture, a part of the corrupted matter might not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ward through the Suture; or whether some Veins in the Brain, or its Membranes were broken, from which the bloud issuing out▪ and turned into corruption, might not stir up those cruel Symptoms; and therefore he perswaded them to separate the Pericranium from the Skull, and also to Perforate the Skull if the Symptoms went not off: he desired also, the Conference with another Physitian, one who was much experienced in Chyrurgery▪ who being sent for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining all the circumstances, did totally agree with him; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, for the greater caution, that the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ricranium should be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, otherwise they could never promise to themselves any security. Which he confirmed both by reason and experience: but to this, a third Physitian and a Chyrurgion, who were brought in by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Wound was therefore healed up: but from that time the Patient began to be troubled with great pains all over the head, but chiefly in the inward part, where the Incision was made, day and night giddiness and great weakness afflict him; he passeth the nights without sleep, loaths his meat, suffereth a continual heat in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts, while the lower shake and are cold.

               <p>Hence two questions arise. First, Whether the opening, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Skin on the head, performed by the Chyrurgion, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, were necessary. The second, Whether blows on the head be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and mortal. To the first I answer, That not only the Incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Skin of the Head, made by the Chyrurgion, but also the Dissection of the Pericranium, and the Perforation of the Skull by a Trepan, was extreamly necessary; by reason of the appearance of those urging Symptoms, which did indicate some hurt under the Skull. To the second, That Contusions, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h, or without a Fissure of the Skull, are never to be slighted: we see they are able to cause death after an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred days; especially when the Skull being broke, it is not opened with the Trepan, to purge that matter which descends by degrees through the Fissure to the Brain, and Dura Mater. These Questions were proposed to me by the most eminent <hi>D. D.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:154387:133"/> was struck, by a <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse-man, two great blows, with a Battle-Axe, on the hinder part of his head; in such sort, that being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and thrown down to the ground, he was taken Prisoner by the contrary Party; and the Sign being given for their retreat, he, with other of his Fellow-Souldiers, was brought in, half dead, unto the Hospital at <hi>Ʋlme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these being put into the hands of the Chyrurgions, and Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans appointed by our Senate for the benefit of the sick; among whom, <hi>D. D. Gockelius</hi> was one who was present, were so well looked after, and provided with necessary food, and with inward, and outward Remedies, that many of them returned home safe and well: but our Patient, of whom we are speaking, being bruised (but without any bloody wound) without any Fissure, or any considerable depression of the Skull; about nine weeks being past over, when he could both go and speak very well; felt no longer any pain from the Contusion; and for recreating himself, was often pleased in walking about; was thinking of returning into his own Country, and upon the first occca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion had determined to go away with the Bark: taking his rest in the night safe and and sound, to all mens thinking, he died in his sleep.</p>
               <p>That the cause therefore of so unexspected an accident might not altogether lie hid; my fore-mentioned Collegue humbly desired the Governours of the Hospital of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> that they would grant him power and liberty of looking more accurately into this matter, and of searching into the foundation and beginning of it, by having the Skull opened by the hands of the Chyrurgions; by considering the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes encompassing, and looking into the substance of the Brain it self.</p>
               <p>The Governors willingly granting it; he caused the Skin to be cut cross-wise, and the Pericranium to be separated from the Skull, according to the usual manner, and the Skull to be sawed round; then proceeding in his Dissection, by diligent inspection and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all parts, he could not find any Fissure in the Skull, no the least footstep of any Depression whatsoever; but in the substance of the brain, just under the blow, a large Putrefaction, like rotten Apples, of a fingers breadth, and reaching almost down to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Ventricles of the Brain, and some corruption of the Pia Mater: all other parts untouched.</p>
               <p>Communicating our opinions in this case, we could no ways doubt of the external cause, and violent percussion, which brought both sickness and death to this Souldier; but this threw in some doubts and scruples worthy of our Consideration, and Admiration.</p>
               <p>First, Why the force of the blow did not hurt the neerer parts, rather than those which were farther off, although many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:154387:133"/> of the like nature have been experimentally found true?</p>
               <p>Secondly, How those temperate and clear Animal Spirits can be so highly disturbed, as to admit of, as it were in a moment, a total blasting, and destruction of the Brain?</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, Why that great Putrefaction in the Brain it self, and communicated, to the Pia Mater, should never cause any pain in the inward parts, or any way deprave the inward or outward senses; but on a suddain, take away all sense, and life it self?</p>
               <p>Let Chyrurgions therefore learn by this Observation, not to make slight of any blows on the head, although they find the parts contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brain not hurt. Never to promise, in such cases, an undoubted Cure; nor to permit any irregular diet; but with cautiousness, and prudent diffidence, so to treat their Patients, that they may be true Lights in our sacred Art.</p>

               <p>The defect of those necessary Instruments, delineated and described before, and the administration of the due Manual operation omitted, took away all hopes. We may also take notice, That if the first day

This Coated Tumour being bigger than a Hens Egg, had so insinuated it self into the substance of the Brain, that it did somewhat press upon the third Ventricle. This Sheep, as the Shepheard reports, turned her self round about towards the night all that day she dyed. That which hapned to Sheep, may happen to Men, and women.

The Skull being opened, and the Brain looked into, I found a Tumour on the left-side, both as to its coat, and matter contained in it, not unlike the former described, of the bigness of an ordinary Hens Egg, and partly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the third Ventricle. I gave this answer to those, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what might be the cause of this Tumour contained in a coat, and perhaps no ill one, that the Brain being violently shaken in that part, had contracted a weakness. and the nourishment flowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, was converted into that Matter, and not into the substance of the Brain; from whence again it was evident, that blows on the Head were very much to be looked after; there being scarce any of so perspicacious a Wit and Judgement whatsoever, that the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inward parts to corruption may not sometimes escape his knowledge.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION XII.</hi> Of a Wound of the Head, with an Incision of the Falx, Dura Mater, and Pia Mater.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1635. <hi>Michael Schuelder,</hi> a Souldier of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Praesident of <hi>Elching,</hi> was wounded with a Broad-Sword, by a Souldier of the Emperor's, on the top and back-part of his Head; the wound on the back-part of the Head was simple, but that on the top of the Head, not only with a Depression and Fissure of the Skull; but also with injury to the Dura Mater, and Falx, which receiveth the branches of the Carotidal Artery, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vein. These two Wounds an unskilful Barber, dressed after his fashion, and cured according to the first intention; but what becomes of it? the miserable Patient from hence suffereth most fierce pains, accompanied with a Phrensy, a Convulsion of all parts; and at length an Apoplexy. Things being thus, six weeks after he was hurt, I was sent for by his Wife yet living, and found him perfectly in an Apoplexy: the cause of which depended upon the obstruction of the Nerves, from a great quantity of Matter, which ought to have been purged through the Wound: and so great was the Mass of black and stinking Matter, that forcing a passage through the Nose, and Palat; the Apoplexy went off, and gave me certain Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hutt and Fissure of the inward parts: feeling with my Finger upon the solid parts of the top of the Head, I found a great hole, evidently demonstrating the depression of the Skull; giving my Prognostick therefore, that the Patient was in a great deal of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I caused a Lenitive Glyster to be given; and after that had done working, the Cephalick vein of the Arm to be opened. On the second day I opened the skin, and the Pericranium in the form of a Cross with an Incision Knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> XI. <hi>Fig.</hi> I. I applied astringent Medicines to the Wound dilated, which in performing operations of this nature, it is very necessary should be wide enough. The third day the blood being well stopped, I perforated the Skull five times, with the Trepan of <hi>Aquapesdens,</hi> about the circumference of the Depression, and through every hole, I let down a piece of Linnen dipped in Oyl of Roses, to the Dura Matter, I sprinkled the Bone with the Pouder known to you, and covered the lips of the Wound with a Digestive, Diapalma, and Linnen, thrice doubled, dipped in rough Wine hot, and a convenient Rowler; on the fifth I cut down
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:154387:135"/> the space between the holes, with the turning Saw, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXII. <hi>Fig.</hi> I. This part of the Skull depressed, being now freed from the intire and sound part: this being corrupted from within as farr as the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This done, with my Cross dividing Instrument, <hi>Tab.</hi> II. <hi>Fig.</hi> X. I depressed the Brain gently, and a great quantity of purulent Matter came out that way. To the Dura Mater (whose Falx being cut transversly, the blood continually issued out) and to the Pia Mater also, I applied a piece of Linnen answerable to the hole, dipped in the Oyntment of <hi>Heir. Fabritius,</hi> to the Bone the Pouder and dry Lint, to the lips the Digestive, and over it Diapalma, a Pultiss, and the Rowler. In the evening the Patient was better: and the puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter ceased from discharging it self down by the Nose and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. On the sixth I looked again upon the Membrane, and Falx, and found that the blood issued out, which by reason of the deep Scituation of the Vessels could not be stopped: for Vessels cut in sunder do require the immediate contract of Astrigent and consoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating Medicines, and some compression; both of which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable in this part, for fear of a new Haimorrhagy, and Apop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexy; whereupon I declared to the Wife, and Kindred of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the Wound without danger of his life could not be healed: for the Wound being totally cicatrized, and the matter which used to issue out, being turned into Quitter, it would again excite the same Symptoms, which would be the cause of his death. Giving this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I dressed the Bone, and the lips of the Wound, as I wont, and left open the Wound at the meeting of the Coronal, and Sagittal Sutures, like an Issue in the Head, through which the matter gently came forth; and the Patient went about his business for half a year together; but being overtaken with Wine, he neglected the Ulcer, &amp; suffered it in the space of 24 hours to be healed up: so that not one drop of the matter could come out, and the forementioned Symptoms, not immediately happening, both the Patient and his Wife, did not doubt but he was in most secure health. Till after three Months taken with those Symptoms again, he dyed suddenly. After his death if I had opened his Skull with a Saw, without doubt I should have found matter under the Skull: from this observation it doth plainly appear, that the perforation of the Skull may be performed often with great benefit, not only in the beginning, but also a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the hurt.

After two Months the swelling of the head was every day bigger, and the same Symptoms infested the Boy about the New Moon, in the 3d, and 4th Months: being at length sent for by the Parents, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Tumour, and declared to the standers by, that these Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in my judgment were caused by a sharp matter which did draw and corrode the Pericranium; neither was I deceived in my opinion, for making an Incision with my Knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> II. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. in the form of a Cross, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXX. <hi>Fig.</hi> X. down to the Skull; and evacuating the matter, I layed open the Wound.

               <p>IN the Year 1631. on the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> a Noble Senator of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> was Wounded on the top, and back part of his head, with the loss of the Skin, and plaining away of the Cranium, to the bigness of a Dollar, or Five-shilling piece of Silver. <hi>Nicholas Reutte</hi> filled up the Wound presently with Astringents, and I caused six oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bloud to be taken from the Cephalick Vein, after the working of a Laxative Glyster. On the 5th, the Wound being unbound, and the bone scraped away to the middle, I sprinkled it with the Cephalick Pouder and put on Lint; I applyed a Digestive to the lips of the Wound, and over that Diapalma, and a Pultise to hinder any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. On the 3d day, by reason of a bitterness in his mouth, he took a Potion purging the Gall, and voided often that bilious matter, which made his Mouth, Throat and Stomach bitter. On the 5th he was better. On the 8th, py reason of being bound, he complained much of a pain of the head, about the Wound; for which, I admitted of a Laxative Glyster, which coming away, his pain also ceased. On the 9th, the Wound digested white and equal quitter; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, I mixed some things cleansing with my Digestive. On the 12th, flesh began to grow upon the Skull; whereupon I applyed an Incarnative Medicine, made of the Ceratum Divinum, and Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Betony, till the Skull, by the benefit of this and the Cephalick Pouder, was covered over with solid flesh; and with these ordinary Remedies (yet which seldome fail a Chyrurgion, if after, generally he prescribeth a good Rule of living, and be diligent that the Patient content himself with a slender Diet, and abstain from Wine, and Venery, and keep himself loose) I cured this Noble Person, yet living, and many others, without the Perforation of the Skull.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>COnrade Schieffelen</hi> of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> one of the Emperours Souldiers, about twenty seven years of age, of a hot and drie Temperament, in a most cruel and bloudy Conflict, neer ro <hi>Wittinweir,</hi> on the 9th of <hi>August,</hi> 1638. was wounded with a broad Sword on the hinder part of his head, with dammage to the bone. An Empirick dressed this Wound at first as if it had been a single one. On the 24th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the Patient come to <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> and fell again into the hand of some unskilful Barber; who bound up the Wound as the former till the 31st of <hi>January,</hi> 1639. at which time the Patient was received into the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:154387:138"/> Hospital, where this Barber searched the Wound, partly healed up, and partly covered with an excrescence of flesh, with a slender Probe, which he thrust the third part of its length streight on, not only through the Fissure of the Skull, and both the Membranes; but also (alas how erroniously) into the substance of the Brain it self: out of which a quantity of matter flowed. On the 1, and 2d. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> his body being prepared and purged, the Patient complained of the heaviness of his eyes. On the 3d this imprudent Barber, by the order of the Patient, called me to consult with my most eminent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue, <hi>D. D. Moyses Heldius,</hi> and that most experienced Chyrurgion, <hi>George Reidlin;</hi> looking upon the Wound, and considering the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, we suspected some hidden mischief from the first putting in of the Probe so deep: whereupon I presently cut the Skin in the shape of a Triangle, with an Incision-Knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXX. <hi>Fig.</hi> XI. and bound up the Dilated Wound with Astringents. On the 4th day, the bloud being stopped, looking into the Wound, we found a great broad Fissure of the Skull with two Fungi's. Things being thus, I applyed to the Skull, the Cephalick Pouder and drie Lint; to the lips, a Digestive, and over that Diapalma, and the Cataplasm of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> hindering Inflammation, and a Rouler divided into four parts, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXI. <hi>Fig.</hi> IX, X. On the 6th, the Patient complained of Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of the head, and pain of the right eye. On the 7th he was somewhat better, and took <hi>Bolus's</hi> made out of six drams of Lenitive Electuary, two drams of the Electuary of the juice of Roses, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; whereby he voided bilious matter four times. On the 8th, the Patient complained again of pain of the right eye, and I applyed to him the Fungus, the Aegyptiacum Oyntment of <hi>Hildanus,</hi> mixed with Pouder of burnt Alum, which notwithstanding, did not eat down the Fungi; but so cleared them, that I could put my blunt Probe, <hi>Tab.</hi> VIII. <hi>Fig.</hi> VI. between them: and seeing that the Fissure was so long and broad, and that so many Errours had been committed by the Barber, I would not come to the Trepan, or Perforation of the Skull, that I might not put an Infamy upon that eminent Operation, which hath been helpful to many, for by their Relation it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that not only both the Membranes of the Brain were hurt, but the Brain it self also suffered. On the 9th day, for pain of the head, the Median Vein of the right Arm was opened, and four ounces of bloud taken away; in the evening he was better. On the 14th he slept little by reason the Stove was cold, for Wounds on the head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a moderate heat, and coldness of the air is an enemy to them. On the 15th, the lips of the Wound newly made, appeared red with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, but the Fungi larger: for the drying up the Fungi, I used the Decoctum Divinum.</p>

               <p>But this produced no effect here, although in many others it hath been a present Remedy: whereupon I cut off a piece of the upper part of the greater Fungus with my Rasour. On the 16th, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient seemed well, and complained of his slender Diet. On the 17th he complaintd of a numness all over his right side, and both the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus's appeared bigger than the days before. On the 18th the Patient not being content with what Meals I prescribed, his Sister made ready for him a mixed dish of Apples, and other things, which he vomited up again as soon as they were down, and was very ill after it. On the 19th, a great quantity of purulent matter flowed out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fungi, and the Skull inclined towards yellowness, the lips of the Wound falling away. On the 20th, all the right side was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a Palsie, the Patient slept all night and complained of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. On the 21st, both the Fungi appeared white, and the Skull black and blew. On the 22d, the Patient lost his Speech, began to be Apoplectical, and his right arm was moved about by Convulsive motions. The 23d at nine of the Clock in the forenoon the Patient died. On the 24th I looked upon the Wound, and the Fungi were fallen so flat, that I coold easily put my Ring-finger into the Fissure. I opened the Skull with a Saw; the inward Superficies of the Bone was so corrupted, that the whole bone of the back part of the Head as far as the Lambdoidal Suture was thinner than the <hi>Os Petrosum.</hi> It is also to be noted, that when there is no depression of the Skull, which may prick the coverings of the Brain, and thereby cause great pain, it is not necessary to cause the Patient to crack Nuts, or the stones of any Fruit, to find out whether there be any Fractare of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ull: for this Person cracked Nuts, Philberds, Wallnuts, Cherry-stones, Peach stones; went about his military employment, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:154387:139"/> complained not of pain of his head. Afterwards putting my Probe between the Fungus's, I found a great Abscess contained in its proper Coat, which lay hid on the left side of the Brain: then taking away the Membranes of the Brain, I shewed the Brain it self with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scess in its bag; I lifted up the Process of the Dura Mater, which is called the Falx, that the space between the right at left side of the Brain, with its Vessels, and turning winding figure might come in sight. The Brain being cut cross, and a great part of it being taken away without hurting the left Ventricle, the Abscess appeared; out of which there flowed stinking purulent matter in great quantity: the Abscess being cleansed with Cotton, there appeared about it a thick Membrane which contained this matter: for in the parts about it there appeared no sign of Inflammation or Corruption. Afterwards I shewed the left Ventricle somewhat pressed down, and the right not depressed, but full of clear water: on the left side the Plexus Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roides appeared pale, but on the right side very red.</p>
               <p>From hence we have the cause of the Palsie on the right side, of the Giddiness, of the pain of the right Eye, and of the Convulsion the day before: and therefore where the Skull is hurt or fractured, and a Fungous flesh growing underneath, appeareth above the Skull and Flesh; it is a certain sign that the substance of the Brain, or at least Membranes of the Brain are bruised and turn.</p>

               <p>IN the fore part of the Roof of the Mouth, behind the fore-teeth, there is a remarkable cavity, through which, a Vein, and Artery, together with the skin of the Roof of the mouth, pass into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Nose; out of this hole for three months there had grown an excrescence of flesh, like a Fungus, in the mouth of a Noble Matron, Wife to <hi>D. Albert Sleichers;</hi> out of which, a great quantity of bloud flowed, as often as she did but gently touch it with her tongue: at length this Fungus, or Excrescence of flesh grew to the bigness of a Walnut, so as it hindered her speech; and she made use of a Barber, who applyed some Medicines but in vain. Being sent for, upon the 10th of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year 1641. I looked upon the part affected, and touching the bottom of the Excrescence with a Probe, the bloud presently flowed out: considering this, it was manifest that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of this evil, came through the forementioned hole; and therefore she sometimes made use of <hi>Aquapendens</hi> his Pills, which purged her head very well, and kept a good Dyet. I touched the Excrescence with rectified Spirit of Vitriol, Juice of Purslain, and Tincture of Roses mixed together, and diminished it; and at length extracted the rest with an Instrument which I use to draw out a Polipus. So in the space of ten days, she was restored to health, to the admiration of all. For two years before this began, she was troubled with deafness, and pain of her ear; but since the effusion of bloud, she heareth without pain, so, as I conjecture, the Disease was cured by Mutation, or Transposition.</p>

Notwithstanding (lest in the space of some few months the Disease may not grow worse, which certainly it will, unless fit Remedies upon the first occasion be made use of) I will propose what ought to be done in this case; and according to my judgment, the Cephalick Vein of the right Arm should be opened, and six or seven ounces of bloud let out. This being done, for revulsion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation sake, the Lady should admit a Seton to be made between the first and second Vertebra of the Neck; or instead of it, apply a blistering Plaster to the Neck every third month, and make an Issue four fingers above the left knee, <hi>Tab.</hi> XLIII. <hi>Let.</hi> I. and in the most convenient place of the right Arm, <hi>Tab.</hi> XLIII. <hi>Let.</hi> H.

                  <head>The Extract of a Letter written at <hi>Heilbrun,</hi> March <hi>7. 1643.</hi>

                  <p>The Tumour upon the right Jaw, after the use of the Decoction of Sarsa, was decreased, and almost disappeared; and it pleased Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God so to direct the Cure, that I thought it had been perfectly well: but unhappily, after Christmas Holy-days, by the consent and advise of a Physitian, I went into an ordinary Bath, and was scarce come out of it before I felt an alteration, and increase of the Tumour, and from hence I feell daily a greater compression, not without pain, as in former time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from hence, the benefit of the Decoction of Sarsa is evident.</p>
                  <p>But after some months, using the Bath, and her head being heated, the Tumour, upon much grief, and continual shedding of tears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to the former bigness. Things being thus, the Patient came from <hi>Heilbrun</hi> to <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> to be cured. Consulting therefore with the most excellent <hi>D. D. Christopher Eysenmenger,</hi> Physitian to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Heilbrun:</hi> we gave our Prognostick, hoping for very good success if the bone was not hurt. She being therefore purged and let bloud; upon the second of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. we placed the Lady in her bed, binding her hands to her side. Then one of the standers by, drew the upper lip, upward, with a hook, that with my separating Knife I might come conveniently between the Tumour, and the first Muscle, which lifteth up the lip. I passed this Knife as far as the Suture of the Os Jugale, and separated the Tumour from the foresaid Muscle; but lower, neer to the grinding Teeth, and the Gum, I
<pb facs="tcp:154387:147"/> found the coat of the Tumour Cartilagineous, and in vain attempted to bring it from the fourth bone of the upper Jaw; so that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cut the bag; which being cut, there flowed out a thick yellow matter like to honey, and the Tumour subsided: the matter being taken out, and the Cartilage cut off with the Pincers, I bound up the Wound with the white of an Egg, the Pouder of Chrysolite prepared, and the Astringent Pouder of <hi>Galen.</hi> The next day the blood being stopped, I found a little swelling neer the second Muscle, which draweth away the lip, under which there was a hole, through which I could easily pass a blunt Probe into the hollowness of the bone. On the 12th day, in the presence of Dr. <hi>Eysenmenger,</hi> I cut into the swelling, and dilated the hole. On the 13th, after the departure of Dr. <hi>Eysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menger,</hi> I found, neer to the Dog-tooth, another swelling, hard as a bone; which also I cut out with the Pincers, <hi>Tab.</hi> XI. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. The space where the bag was, between the last grinding tooth, and the dog tooth, was so consolidated, that not one drop of matter came out, but I kept the hole open, till the bone might skale by the help of the decoction of Sarsa, and the bone being taken way, I healed up the Wound.</p>

Four days days before his decease, I proposed to his Parents, the burning of the hinder part of his head, which had helped many others, as I had often experienced: but the Parents refusing it; I made use of such Remedies, as are used in these great swellings, and itching of the Gums, Fever, and Catarrhe. Notwithstanding which, without any manifest Convulsions of the parts, any noise, or grinding of the Teeth; he, who was the last hope of this Family, being taken with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, departed this life.

               <p>IN the Year 1628. on the 2d of <hi>March,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Jacob Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mermans</hi> brought forth a fine Boy, the Ligament of whose Tongue a Midwife (whose name I spare) cut in pieces with her Nails, that he might afterwards speak the more articulately: but so great a pain and inflammation succeeded this Operation, that it hindered the Child from taking hold of the Nipple, or rather from sucking. The Parents ascribed this inability of sucking to the string of the Tongue; and thinking the Nurse had not sufficiently delivered the Tongue from its Ligament, sent for a Chyrurgion, who with the like Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, cut in pieces both the Ligament, and Vessels of the Tongue;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:154387:150"/> out of which, the bloud flowed to the Wind-pipe, and the third day choaked the Child. The Child being dead; the Mother began to complain of swelled Breasts, by reason of the concretion of the Milk; and the right breast being ill handled, at last degenerated into an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated Cancer: and the Woman, after suffering most grievous pains, died.</p>
               <p>A Girl new born, after that a Chirurgion had cut the string of her tongue with a common Lancet, by reason of the pain she was able to suck very little of her Mothers Milk, and the right breast growing hard, she put her Child to the left; and the pain under the tongue being mitigated, the Milk returned into both Breasts; but the hard Tumour would not be softened without the Child sucking it; and she perceived already, that the Vertebrae of the Childs back were distort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the right side, occasioned by applying the Child always to one Breast. From these two Examples it is apparent how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the string of the Tongue is often rent by the Midwives Nails, and the Chyrurgions Lancet; and how much the lawful and just manner of doing it is to be esteemed: which, with many cautions, is proposed to us by <hi>Fabritius ab Aquapendente:</hi> concerning which, see <hi>Tab</hi> XXXVI. <hi>Fig.</hi> VIII.</p>

               <p>The Body being sufficiently purged from thick humours, I applyed to the part affected, the Ceratum Oxeloeum, softned with Oyl of Lizards; the description of which is this.</p>
               <p>Take green Lizards alive, as many as you please; boil them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyl till the Lizards be burnt, and the Oyl be black; what is strained out, put into a glass, and set in the Sun, till the dreggs fall down, and the Oyl cleareth, and becomes of a brown colour: and I exhibited for thirty days together, every morning, six drams of the Electuary which <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Prevotius</hi> esteemed as a great secret, and certain Remedy in the Cure of the Kings-Evil, and prepared it thus.</p>
               <p>Take common Lizards, or green Lizards, the heads and tails cut off, and the inwards taken out, infuse them by themselves in very sharp White-Wine Vinegar, and made without Pepper, for four days, then drie them, and steep them in other Vinegar, and drie them again, either in the Shade, or Sun, and Pouder them; this being done, mix an ounce of the Pouder with four ounces of Hony: which is to be taken for thirry, or forty days: two drams is the dose for children, but for men or women, half an ounce, six drams an ounce at highest.</p>

               <p>A Noble Woman of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> on the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> 1627. while her Courses were upon her, in the evening, was taken with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Quinsie, which made her breath with difficulty, and hindered her from swallowing either Meat or Drink: being called to her, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently order'd a Laxative Glister, and that being come away, six ounces of blood to be taken out of the Median Vein of the Arm. On the 8th of <hi>July,</hi> a stronger Glister was given her, and after it had done working, she sitting up in her Bed, a Barber opened the Veins under the Tongue, and applyed Cupping-Glasses, without Scarification, to the inside of her Thighs: which he had also done the day before, with a great deal of Fire, not only lest the Menstruous Purgations should be stopped, but also to hinder the Humours flowing to the part affected. Afterwards I removed the Cupping-Glasses, and prescribed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a Gargarism; which, in all dangerous Quinsies, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Augmentation, is highly commended to wash the Throat therewith often in a day.</p>

I ordered first a blystering Plaister, and then a Seton to be made in the Neck: both which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies being made use of without any perceivable advantage to the Patient, I called to mind that which I had inserted amongst my collection of Observations in the Year 1620. The Body of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poor Woman of <hi>Padoa</hi> (who had been troubled with an Amau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosis for twenty years together, coming by degrees upon her, and at last with an inward Cancer upon the Left Breast, which by repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medicines was driven in and killed her) was brought into the Anotamical Theatre; where, in the presence of many Students, I sought for the true cause of this blindness; and opening the Skull, I found the first and second Ventricle of the Brain, sunk down, and glued together; so that the Animal Spirits could not be carried through them to the Eyes: upon which by degrees, the Optick Nerves withered away; for they appeared as little again, as in others. Thus the Amaurosis came upon her, the eye it self being not at all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:154387:153"/> hurt, but still well nourished by the Artery coming to the root of it, which was full and fair, and sometime suffered an Inflammation from the regurgitating of the courses. The most excellent <hi>Spigelius</hi> added in his Anatomical Lecture (Reading upon the head of this poor Woman) that this blindness could no ways be Cured, although <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanius</hi> affirmeth, that a Wound on the Forehead did once take away such a Gutta Serena. From hence also it is evident, that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease doth not always arise from the obstruction of the Optick Nerves; but doth only insinuate such a disposition. Neither is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, if it yield not to the most Experienced, and Methodical way way of Curing.</p>

               <p>IN the general cure of Contusions of the Head, I formerly took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Skull of those who were grown up, is seldome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed without a Fissure, either in the inward, or outward Table, unless in those, whose Skulls are naturally softer than ordinary. This is confirmed by this Observation of a Serving-Maid of <hi>Michael Riet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who in the thirtieth year of her age, carrying a Vessel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon her head, fell down, and hurt the right side of the fore-part of her head: which being much swelled, <hi>Nicholas Reutte</hi> was sent for, who applyed a Lamb-skin warm to the part: the next day the Skin being taken off, perceiving a hollowness, I declared to the standers by, that there was a Depression of the Skull, and the necessity of dividing the Skin; which being granted, I cut the skin with an Incision-Knife, into the form of a Cross, and presently perceived a small Depression on the outward Table of the Skull, without any Fissure. The Wound being bound up, I was very doubtful whether the inward Table was intire, because the fall was from a high place; and therefore I proposed the use of the Trepan, but the Patient would not admit of it, declaring then, that this Wound or Depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if there were a Fissure in the inward Table, could not well be healed, without Perforating the Skull; but if that were intire, the Patient might with less danger be Cured. I kept the Wound open 12 days, and not any one Symptom happening, which did argue either the Fissure of the Skull, or any other hurt of the Brain, I healed it up.</p>

The next morning, being sent for, I found the Skull freed from the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium, and fractured with a doubtful Fissure; and being provided with Scraping-Irons, I presently scraped down the Fissure below the space between the two Tables, where I perceived the inward Table of the Skull to have only a capillary Fissure: whereupon, removing the Scraping-Irons, I dressed the Wound, and the Bone, with my accustomed Dressings, and happily restored the Boy in the space of 24 days: who, without the use of the Scraping-Irons, as frequent Experience testifieth, might have perished.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:154387:154"/> Skull, and the Pericranium; from whence these pains proceeded: and separated from the bone, the Insertions of those Muscles which are called <hi>Splenij,</hi> and <hi>Recti,</hi> and serve to extend the head. The Patient being received into the Hospital of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> desired the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgions help: wherefore, after Generals, and a slender Diet, I cut the outward Skin with an Incision-Knife, in the shape of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, down to the Bone, taking care, lest the Fibres of the foresaid Muscles should be cut in pieces; and hereby making a passage for the included mater to flow out, I found the bone rough, and corroded with the matter: which being evacuated, I filled up the lips of the Wound with an Astringent Medicine well down; and the next day scraped the rough bone all about with the Scraping-Irons: this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration being performed, I sprinkled the Cephalick Pouder upon the Skull, and applyed a Digestive to the Wound; till that within two days time the Skull was covered over with solid Flesh: the Bone being covered, I Incarnated the Wound with Betony Oyntment, and Cicatrized it with the Certaum Divinum. Twenty days after the scraping, the Skull threw off some Skales, and the pain of the Head returned: but pulling out the little bones, with the Pincers, the pain presently ceased.

               <p>Enquiring into the cause of this, she informed me, that half a year before, she laboured under a violent Fever, which terminated in an
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:154387:154"/> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scess upon this part. This Abscess the Physitian, otherwise very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and <hi>Matthew Memminger,</hi> a Barber, after Suppuratives, opened with a Caustick, not very pleasingly, (for it being applyed for 36 hours, it caused very sharp pains, and frequent faintings) and took out the Eschar, which was about the bigness of a Dollar, with a Lancet; which being violently taken away, there flowed out a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low stinking matter, but in small quantity.

The next day I drew out the Root with the Pincers, it being swelled up with a bilious undigested matter, and black at the end; and searching the cavity to find out the cause of this colour, I found the bone rough and moveable: for the greater dilatation therefore of the hole, I put in a bigger Root, with the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Diacalcitis, and the former Bandage to keep in the Root, and anointed the parts about it to hinder any Inflammation, which the pain, arising from the Dilatation, although it were not vehement, might easily cause. The third day I put in another bigger Root, and so gradually I encreased daily the bigness of the Tent, till the hole was big enough to take out the bone, which was almost separated. The sixth day I filled up the Fistula with Buttons, made of Spunge, fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:154387:155"/> Faction, upon the left side, about the fourth Short-rib: the Cartilaginous part being cut in pieces, the Kell coming out with a great loss of blood, attended by divers Symptoms; as Fainting, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and a great pain and swelling about the Midriff. Being called, I presently put in the Omentum, or Kell intire, and put a Tent into the Wound, with Hemp-hards dipped in the Yolk and White of an Egg beaten up together, sprinkled over with an Astringent Pouder, and fastened to a thread, and over it the Diapalma Cerate, and the Bandage of <hi>Sostratus.</hi> On the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> about six in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the Pain, Swelling, and Inflammation about the Wound, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the former Cataplasm. On the fifth day of the month, the Pain, and Swelling somewhat abated, and the bloud being stopped, I unbound the Wound, and put in a Tent dipped in a Digestive,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:154387:156"/> and fastened to a thread, and over it the same Cerate Cataplasm, and Bandage as before. The same day I gave him Broth made with Burnet, Setfoile, Comfrey, Horsetail, Speedwel, Strawberry leaves, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon seeds, that the matter contained in the Belly might be discharged by the Urinary passages, mixing Astringents with them, lest without the use of these, he should bleed a fresh. Towards the evening he complained of an itching in the Urinary passage, a sign that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the cavity of the Belly, by the benefit of the Diureticks, was voided by Urine.</p>
               <p>On the sixth day of the month the pain went off, and the swelling about the Wound vanished; and the Patient saying that he felt a greater itching when he made water, I looked upon the Urine, and found a great deal of matter mixed with it.</p>
               <p>On the 7th day the Patient complained of a pain upon the right Shoulder, and towards the evening, of a pain of the Liver, Fever, and dry Cough.</p>
               <p>And upon the 8th, the former pains, and Feverish heat increasing, I took four ounces of blood out of rhe Basilica of the right arm; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the pains ceased after an hour or two, and the Fever decreased.</p>
               <p>Upon the 9th, the matter was digested, and the Patient was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise well; so that I began to consolidate the Wound, diminishing the Tent daily, till it came to be Cicatrized; but the Patient in the night feeling pains like to the Colick, about the Os Sacrum, or Ramp bone, and the Region of the Bladder; I prescribed, upon the 10th day, this following Potion.</p>

               <p>Upon taking this, he vomited up a great quantity of Choler, and had twenty Stools, voiding with them much bilious matter, which had been the cause of these pains: after this evacuation, the Patient was better, and the pains altogether abated, till the 23d day; at what time, keeping a bad Diet he fell into a bilious loosness, and by the perswasion of some Women, he fed eagerly upon Sloes, which gave him the Colick, with a continual desire of going to stool, without being able to do it. For which, on the 24th, I gave him, in Succory water, a dram of Rubarb poudered; and two hours after his taking the Rubarb, this following Potion.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION XLII.</hi> Of a dangerous Wound on the Breast.</head>
               <p>ON the 9th of <hi>February,</hi> 1633. the Noble <hi>Nicholas Dietrick,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Sphereiter,</hi> received two Wounds in a Duel, from the Generous <hi>Rittwein,</hi> a <hi>Swedish</hi> Serjeant Major; the first of which was on the left Wrist, running down to the hand, the Veins and Tendons being hurt. The other upon the right Breast, a fingers breadth below the Pap, which penetrated into the cavity of the Thorax, hurt the Intercostal Vessels, and caused spitting of bloud. By reason of these dangerous Symptoms, and faintness especially, he was carried home in a Coach with four Horses, where all things requisite for the Wound were proposed: amongst others, I judge this worthy to be noted, before the first binding up of the Wound, some out of that great throng of standers by said, they would suck out the bloud which was within the Thorax; and being permitted, they did suck indeed, but it was not bloud, but rather Gold; and one while he was sucking stole privately a Diamond Ring from off the Patients finger, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out, he restored it again. Being sent for, I looked upon the Wound on the Breast, and putting a blunt Probe through the hole into the cavity, I found it filled with bloud; and from his spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud, suspected that the Lungs were wounded; and therefore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:154387:157"/> I cast in with a Siphon, through the Wound with the White of an Egg, with the Astringent Pouder of <hi>Galen,</hi> Chrysolite prepared, and a little Plantain Water. I put also into the Wound, a Tent made of Hemp-hards dipped in the same, and tied to a string. I anointed the parts about it with Oyl of Roses, and put over it a Cerate of Diapalm. and bound it up with Linnen thrice doubled, dipped in Red-wine, and pressed out, and the Bandage of <hi>Sostratus, Tab.</hi> XXXII. <hi>Fig.</hi> VI. To the Wound in the Wrist, the same Remedies were applyed for the stopping of the blood; and to preserve his strength, and to stop the bloud in the Breast, he often took this following Water.</p>

               <p>For his thirst, he drank Barly water mixed with Syrup of Coral, and Tincture of Roses; strictly observing a slender Diet. For his Fever, and spitting of bloud, both for Revulsion, and Ventilation sake, I ordered the Liver Vein to be opened of the same side, and four ounces of bloud to be taken away. This being done, he took nothing but the Decoction of Barly, mixed with the Tincture of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Barly Ptisan for his Supper.

               <p>This Glister wrought thrice, and after that, I unbound the Wound; out of which there flowed a little bloud. At the same time the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient complained of a great Pain, and Heat of that side which was wounded, by reason of the heat of the bloud gathered together within the Thorax: and seeing that the bloud could not get out, by reason of the streightness of the Wound, although the Patient were placed in the same Posture in which he was Wounded: it was necessary to make way for the bloud, either by dilating the Wound with the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> XII. <hi>Fig.</hi> I. and <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXVII. <hi>Fig.</hi> V. or by a new Section between the third and fourth Rib, beginning to reckon from the lowermost, according to <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his way, who began his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the last or twelfth; because this may easily be felt with the fingers, and it is the same, as to say, between the ninth, and tenth Rib, beginning to reckon from the uppermost. The Dilatation of the Wound had been in vain attempted; because the greatest part of the bloud contained in the Breast, was gathered together about the Midriff: nor could I make the Paracentesis to any advantage, either on the right, or left side; in the left it had not been conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, because the matter was gathered in the right; nor could it be performed in the right, by reason of the great swelling and pain of the Back and Liver; and to expect the evacuation of it, by spitting, or Urine, would be too dangerous, by reason of the great quantity of matter, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

On the 11th, the Patient being in good health, and nothing more coming out of the Cavity of the Breast; lest the Wound should degenerate into a Fistula of the Breast, omitting the Pipe, I put in a Tent fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to a string, covered with the Betony Oyntment, and over it the yellow Cerate.</p>
               <p>On the 12th, 13th, and 14th, the Patient complained not, and said he was strong enough to walk without a staff.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION XLIII.</hi> Of a Wound on the Breast, requiring the Paracentesis.</head>
               <p>IN the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1622. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Waggoner of <hi>Padoa,</hi> was wounded in the Back, the Sword piercing as far as the right Breast, so that there was two Wounds: which caused him to fall to the ground in a swound, loosing his voice, being in a cold sweat, with an intermitting pulse, and vomiting of blood: which gave sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of the Heart, or Stomach being Wounded. I bound up the Wound on both sides; but first I Dilated the Orifice in the Breast, with a hooked Knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXVII. <hi>Fig.</hi> V. <hi>E.</hi> and put into both of them a Tent of Hemp-Hards, dipped in the white of an Egg, and fastned to a String; and omitted nothing that was necessary to be done to such Wounds. The Wound being bound up, by reason of his great weakness, the use of Wine was granted him: and yet for a whole day, I could not perceive with my Fingers, any Pulse of the Arteries in his Wrist.</p>
               <p>The next day, although a great quantity of blood flowed out of the Wound▪ yet no Pulse could be perceived, unless the Patient turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself from place to place, or from side to side; the same day he took Panada, which he vomited up presently, from whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Stomach to be Wounded.</p>
               <p>On the third day the Patient breathed with difficulty, and felt a great pain near to the Diaphragme, on the Wounded side, scarce a drop came out of the Wound, and what is very much, the Pulse was very deficient; For this cause, between the third and fourth Rib (<hi>Tab.</hi> XXXVII. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. ♃) according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the breast was opened, to this intent: that the matter contained in the Thorax might be evacuated, least the natural heat should be choaked, and the substance of the Lungs putrified: the Perforation being made, scarce three, or four drops of blood came out of the Wound; which I think is worthy to be noted; because say some, there will be a great Flux of blood from the Incision of the Intercostal Vessels. I do not deny, but that somtimes, and that in bilious Bodies, such a Flux of blood may fall into the Cavity when the Vein, or Artery is cut; but this may easily be avoided with the Incision-Knife, <hi>Tab.</hi> XI. <hi>Fig.</hi> I. and supposing the

His Pulse was most manifest, and from the upper Wounds a purulent matter, in some small quantity issued out; I therefore prescribed him this following Syrup, to drink four ounces of it early in the morning, and towards the evening, two hours before Supper,</p>

               <p>The 7th. day, the Patient had a higher Feaver, then the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the Quitter came out in a greater quantity, but not smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so ill, as up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>On the 8th. the lips of the Wound, made between the third and fourth Ribs inflamed. Upon which the Patient suffered greater pain, and a higher Feaver.</p>
               <p>On the 9th. day, the stinking of the Purulent matter did evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abate, but in the evening there appeared about the new Wound. St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire, the hole being larger, and the third Rib bare.</p>
               <p>On the 10th. the artificial Wound appeared larger than the day before. The cause of which Dilatation, in my judgement, was the bilious humour, which corroded the fleshy substance with its Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; in the night he felt great pains about the Baster'd Ribs, by reason of the Eresypelas, and the Intercostal Nerve inserted into the descending Muscle of the Belly.</p>
               <p>On the 11th. day he was better, and slept all night: he would not admit of the Siphon, by reason of the soreness of the Pleura, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, stretched under the Ribs.</p>
               <p>On the 12th. He felt as great pain as the day before, therefore
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:154387:161"/> omitting the Tent, I applyed a piece of Spunge, pressed out of the Vulnerary Decoction, in the night he sweat twice, all over his Body.</p>
               <p>On the 13. He was better, and white Quitter came out. In these cases, there is no better remedy, then not to purge the Body: for if any Purge be given, all the humours flow to the Guts; the Body is extenuated, and many bad Symptoms happen upon it.</p>
               <p>On the 14th. He slept well, and the matter came out of the Wound in a small quantity. In the evening there came more away, and the Pulse seemed greater than ordinary.</p>
               <p>On the 15th. His Feaver was higher then the day before; because the Patient had rested on his left-side, which was sound, and not on his right-side, which was Wounded: so that the matter contained in the Thorax encreased the Feaver. In the evening a Tent was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wound in his side, because the Flesh grew too fast.</p>
               <p>On the 16th. For a bitterness he felt in his mouth, three or four days together, he took Rubarb, and voided four times bilious excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after which he was better.</p>
               <p>On the 17th. I gave him the ordinary Decoction, in the evening white Quitter came out, in a very small quantity. Whereupon the Decoction was not injected with the Seringe: his Cough left him, he slept well in the night, but the Feaver was somwhat higher than the day before.</p>
               <p>On the 18th. I neither injected the Decoction, nor put a Tent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wound, but only Pledgits, with Betony Oyntment, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it the Ceratum Barbarum. The Quitter inclined rather to green than white: he slept in the night, but quarrelled in his sleep, a sign of the abundance of bad humours in the Body.</p>
               <p>On the 19. He sweat all the night, the Quitter was fomwhat green still: four hours before Dinner, he took an ounce and a half of Cassia newly extracted, dissolved in Broth, in which Succory, Borage, Burnet, and Speedwell, were boyled, which Purged him thrice, the excrements being very bilious,</p>
               <p>On the 20th. Half an ounce of Quitter came out. A Pipe of Tin was put into the Wound, made by Art, it being Dilated by the Tent, with a Spunge pressed out of Red Wine. The 20th. He could not sleep all the night, because the Pipe pressed upon the Ribs, and Membrane.</p>
               <p>On the 21st, nothing came out of the Wound, yet the Pipe was put in as the day before. Then he took the Cassia dissolved in the former Broth, with pouder of Rubarb, black Mechoacan, and Crem of Tarter: he drunk no longer of the Vulnerary Decoction, but of broth made with some Herbs, as Succory, Borage, Sowthistle, Strawberry Leaves, and Peruinckle, the Wound in the Breast was healed up.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:154387:161"/>
               <p>On the 22d, he took the same Broth again. On the 23d, the Vulnerary Decoction was once again Injected, and a little quitter came out; which, because it was somewhat green, the Patient took the Purging Pouder again.</p>
               <p>On the 26th, 27th, 28th, I did not Inject the Vulnerary Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bound up the Wound once a day; after two days the Fever decreased.</p>
               <p>On the 29th, the Patient took his Broth, the quitter white, and the Patient almost out of danger.</p>
               <p>On the 36th, when I looked again upon the Wound, a great quantity of matter flowed out, and the Lips were swelled; a sign that he had committed some error in his Diet; and being asked, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed he had eaten of some Milk-dishes which were forbidden: from which, he abstained after that, and was in a short time very happily restored.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION XLIV.</hi> Of a Fistula in the Breast, Perforated with a Needle.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1630. an Officer of the Emperours being desperately Wounded, three fingers breadth below the right Clavicle, and almost cured at the sign of the Plough in <hi>Ʋlme;</hi> upon some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror committed in his Diet, was troubled with an Inflammation, which suppurated, and degenerated into a large hollowness under the skin: the bottome of which, descended as low as the eighth Rib; so that neither the Chyrurgion, nor the Physitian could purge the matter out of this hollowness, unless they daily set the Patient upon his head, with his heells upward: but seeing that the Consolidating of this hollowness was delayed, and the Patient much disturbed every day, by the turning up his body, he commanded me to be sent for, being recommended to him by the Host of the House. Coming to him, and perceiving what it was I proposed the cutting open the hollowness, which useth to succeed very happily, being performed with the Scolopomachaerion; but this Operation not being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I thought of a way, whereby, without laying open the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the matter might find a passage: therefore the Orifice being Dilated with Gentian, I put in an Instrument, <hi>Tab.</hi> XIV. <hi>Fig.</hi> V. to the sharp end of which, a little ball of Wax was fastened, and without the Patients knowledg, (for he thought I was only searching the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:154387:162"/> of the hollowness.) I presently perforated the bottome, and drew out the Needle. The matter being evacuated by the passage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I put a Tent into the lower Wound, besmeared over with a whole Egg; and to the upper, one dipped in Betony Oyntment, and putting on a Diapalma Plaster, and Linnen four times doubled, I bound up the whole breast with the Bandage of <hi>Sostratus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards kept open the Wound for some days, with a sharp hollow Tent made out of Linnen, covered over with the wax, till I consolidated the upper with the Ceratum Divinum, and cleansed the sides of the hollowness with Water and Honey, applying a new Spung pressed out of Red-wine, and with the Bandage that <hi>Galen</hi> calls the Breast-plate, in the last <hi>Table</hi> S. being straitly bound, it conglutinated, the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness growing together. I every day diminished the hollow Tent, and at last Cicatrized the Ulcer. This Operation doth best succeed when the hollowness hath not contracted any Callus, otherwise it doth not answer our desires.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1645. <hi>Nicholas Rohler,</hi> Waterman and Citizen of <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> was wounded with a Bakers Knife upon his back, between the 4th, and 5th Rib, reckoning from above, and his Lungs hurt, so that the Patient presently, besides spitting of bloud, complained of a great difficulty of breathing, being sent for the first hour that he was hurt, I injected with the Seryinge an Astringent mixture into the Cavity of the Thorax, and kept the Wound open with a Tent; for preserving his strength, and stopping the bloud. I prescribed an Electuary, (whose Ingredients may be seen in Observation 41.) and a slender Dyet. At my going away, I declared to the standers by, that the Patient would certainly die, unless there were very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a new Wound made below the other, but they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. In the morning I proposed to the Patient, the Paracente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who presently consented to it; and by that means, not neglecting other Remedies, he was very happily recovered, and hath lived divers years since in very good health.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION L.</hi> Of another Wound on the Breast, Dilated with the Knife.</head>
               <p>ON the 5th. of <hi>December, Adam N.</hi> a Barber, came to me, and told me, that the most Reverend Mr. <hi>Snitzer,</hi> Parish Priest, in the Vilage of <hi>Eingen;</hi> the day before, about Supper-time, had been Wounded by a Souldier of the Emperors, with two Wounds; of which, one was on the right-side of the lower Jaw: the other on the Back, near the Back-bone, between the third and fourth Rib, (in that place in which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> used to make, the Paracentesis) of the right-side, Penetrating into the Cavity, as far as the uppermost Rib of the same side, a little lower, than where the Clavicle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to the top of the Sternon, Wounding the Lungs, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercostal Vessels. Upon which, these Symptoms followed, great faintness, difficulty of breathing, cold sweats, and very great pains about the Breast. The wound in the Back, a Barber dressed with a Tent, dipped in the white of an Egg. putting in only an Ear-Spoon, between the fleshy Membrane and the Muscle; and applying the Stictick Plaster of <hi>Crollius.</hi> The Wound in the lower Jaw was sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the difficulty of breathing was very troublesome; and the pains very great on the Breast, both before, and behind; by reason that the intercostal Vessels were Wounded. I searched the Wound which was narrow, with a blunt Probe, and went into the cavity of the Thorax: a sign there was great quantity of blood collected therein.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I presently cast in this following mixture, with a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, into the Cavity of the Breast, to stop the blood.</p>

               <p>THE Wife of <hi>Peter Hielbronner,</hi> had a small hidden Cancer in her right Breast, and a great Ulcerated one in the left. The hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den one after the use of the Magistral Decoction, was diminished with the Ceratum Oxelaeum stirred up in a Leaden Morter; and the sharp pains of the Ulcerated Cancer were mitigated, with that most excellent Anodine for a Cancer, as long as she lived, to wit, with a mixture of the Linimentum Simplex, the Ceratum Oxelaeum, and Oyl of Myrtles. The same Patient complained every year, of a very troublesome galling on the Hips caused by her being so fat: for when she walked, especially in Summer time, those Parts were rubbed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excoriated, and inflamed. This excoriation the Patient her self cured, by often washing it in fresh water, in which, Mallows were boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and besprinkling it with this Pouder easie to be had.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION LVII.</hi> Of an ulceration and pain on the Breast mitigated by an Issue in the Thigh.</head>
               <p>A Water-man of fourscore years of Age, complained of a great streightness, a violent pain, and blisters on the right side of his Breast. The Patient sent for a Chyrurgion, and desired him again, and again, to heal up those little Ulcers, which were very troublesome to him. Those Ulcers being healed; the pain, and streightness about his Breast returned; which went off upon the breaking out of his Breast. Things being thus, and being sent for to advise about it, I asked the old Man whether he had not formerly had old Ulcers in his Legs? to which he answered, that for ten years together he had a large Ulcer on his right Thigh, without any hindrance to him in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and from the time that it was healed up, he was first troubled with a streightness, then a pain, next with blisters, and at last with little Ulcers about his Breast: for the revulsion therefore of these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, I ordered an Issue to be made in that Thigh which was first Ulcerated, with the Instrument of <hi>Julius Cessarius Placentinus:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which there began to be an inflamation the next day; so that I encouraged the Patient to hope for a good recovery. The Eschar being come out, and the Issue performing its duty: the pain of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Breast, and difficulty of breathing abated: so that in thirty days the Patient was free from those Symptoms; and long after that enjoyed the health of an old Man, and went about his business, without any hindrance. From this I would have young Chyrurgions learn how dangerous it is, to heal up Ulcers of long continuance, especially in old Age; and with how great benefit Issues are made, on the inside of the Thigh; if by the error of the Patient, or Chyrurgion such Ulcers which free the Body from impurities, have been healed up.</p>

The Wound on the Breast being of little moment, we dressed as a simple one; but the Wound near to the Os Sacrum, being very painful, caused so great an inflammation, that it did also affect the privy parts; and for stopping of the Blood we injected into it the white of an Egg▪ stirred up with a Spatula: with the astringent Pouder of <hi>Galen,</hi> prepared Chrysolite, and Plantain water: for revulsion sake, a cooling Glyster was put up, and Blood taken from the Median vein of the right Arm.

We put in a shorter Tent into the Wound about the Os Sacrum; and to the sides a Spunge pressed out in Red Wine lukewarm, and bound it up streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Bandage. The Wound on the Occiput being still hollow, sent out serous matter without pain.</p>
               <p>On the 10th.

Having rested again very well the whole night. On the 13th. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Souldiers Wintered in his House, he Rode home, the Wound in his Head not being yet consolidated: in the mean time the Chyrurgion visited him every day, and dressed the Wound. After ten days the Chyrurgion desired me to prescribe the Patient a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Potion, which I did; and it gave him divers stools. The next day the Chyrurgion came again, telling me, that he was forced to lay open the Wound; and that he very well understood the manner how to do it. <hi>February</hi> the 28th. he opened it, but with what Knife I know not.

Things being thus, I advised the Patient to be brought to <hi>Ʋlme</hi> again, in a Litter. On the 4th. Being in the City, I unbound the Wound, and found that the Erysipelas had spread it self, not only about the Wound, but all over the fore-part, and hinder-part of the Head; so that, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent complained of a great pain of his Head, and could by no means open his Eyes.</p>

                  <hi>OBSERVATION LIX.</hi> Of a Wound in the Breast mortal, upon neglecting the Paracentesis.</head>
               <p>ON the 10th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1645, At eight of the Clock in the evening, a certain young Man received a very narrow Wound in the Back, two Fingers breadth below the right Shoulder Bone, and four Fingers breadth from the Back Bone; which Penetrated into the Cavity. A Chyrurgion otherwise not unskilful, (whom the wounded Person sent for immediately upon his being hurt,) dressed this as a simple Wound; and as if it had not Penetrated: so that the blood flowed out of the Intercostal Vessels which were wounded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavity of the Breast, and caused such a streightness, that the Parents ordered them to send for me. About twelve a Clock at night, I unbound the Wound, which by reason of the Figure of the Sword, the Posture of the Breast changed, and the applying of Astringent Medicines, was so narrow, that we could neither come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavity with a Probe, nor inject Medicines to stop the blood, through the Siphon, nor apply them upon the Tent. Wherefore I declared to the Parents and the standers by, the danger the Patient was in; and proposed the Paracenthesis to be made without delay, in the place assigned by <hi>Hippocrates, Tab.</hi> XXXVII. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. {rum}. which might give a Discharge to that matter, which did threaten certain Suffocation; But seeing that the Parents would not admit of this (witnout doubt) necessary operation in this Patient, and the matter, by giving Diureticks, could not so suddenly be evacuated by the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Urine; the Patient being choaked up, dyed on the sixth day; who very probably, if the Dilacation of the Wound had not been neglected at the begining, might have been preserved: for his Lungs were not hurt, because the Patient never did spit blood, nor the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:154387:178"/> Gullet, because he swallowed his Meat, and Drink, without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: his Heart was not wounded, nor yet the Vena Cava, nor great Artery: because if so, the Patient would not have lived so long after his being wounded. The Pericardium or case to the Heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; the Diaphragm was not concerned; because these Symptoms did not appear which all writers in Chyrurgery declare to accompany that Wound. But the Patient complained only of a streightness of the Breast, caused by a copious collection of Blood; hence I would have young Chyrurgions learn, when they they are called to the cure of a Wound on the Breast: to search diligently with their Probe (placing the Patient, if it can be, in the same posture as when he was hurt;) to see if the Wound hath penetrated or no; if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of Gall could be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged through it: Yet nature did not, (as for the most part she doth in such cases) throw that quantity of Gall, into the whole ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, but carried it to the Colon. On the 24. of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 1624. In the body of <hi>Mrs. Katharine N.</hi> a Venetian, who died of an Ulcerated Cancer in the Womb, I found the Bladder of Gall filled and distended with a Stone transparent like Chrystall: so that it was not fit to receive any Gall, yet Nature did send that Gall, which was daily generated to the circumference of the body, but to the Womb. From these two accounts two things may be noted. First that the Jaundise doth not always happen upon an obstruction of the passage or bladder of Gall; but the Gall may sometimes derived to the Guts, the Womb, or some other Noble part. Secondly, the Lecture which the most excellent <hi>Spigeleus</hi> had upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se.

About the Vernal Aequinox, there arose tallowy Tumours on the back of both Hands, which were insensibly dissolved, without applying any thing to the part, upon the taking of a Sudorifick Decoction, whose chief ingredient was Sarsa. In the Year, 1631. Swellings arose on the Wrists, and on both sides of the back of the Hands, to the bigness of a Walnut, causing inflamation, and an Absces; which, being opened with the Knife, cast out the same matter as the former. In the Year, 1632. These Tumours invaded both Arms, and therefore I advised a Cure by sweating; which the Patient being difficult to sweat, was totally against. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suppurated, therefore I opened them with the Knife, and the matter coming away by degrees, I kept the Wounds open with Tents, for two months; in the mean time, washing the Hands every day, an hour, in the Water of the Stribiline well near <hi>Ʋlme;</hi> heated and bound them up with Spunges dipped in the same Water, till the reliques being discussed, the parts recovered their former strength, by the help of this Water, the Youth out of whose Hands I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken divers pieces of corupt Bones, and opened four and twenty Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scesses, was preesrved from any further Relaps, and performs all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his Hands, without the least impediment; taking every three months a Pouder to purge Phlegm.</p>

               <p>The Fracture being composed I applied to the broken bone, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Roots of Orrice and round Birthwood: I put a tent into the Wound made of hemp hards and an astringent Oyntment, which I made of the astringent Powder of <hi>Galen,</hi> and the white of an Egg stirred up. I bound up the Thigh outwardly with three row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and a sufficient number of Plagets. see <hi>Tab.</hi> XXIX. And thus garded I put it into its case. <hi>Tab.</hi> XXVII. The member being thus well composed, by reason of the great pain of the whole leg and back, and the eminent danger of an inflammation, the Chyrurgion ro the Hospital opened the Median vein of the left Arm, and took away four ounces of Blood. On the 2d. and 3d. day, she complained of a pain of the Back, and heat of Urine. On the 4th. and 5th. the Patient answered to what was asked, without complaining, but because her body was bound, the ordinary Phisitian to the Hospital prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her some Bolus's to be made, out of an ounce of Lenitive Electuary, and while they were making up her courses began to flow. On the 6th. 7th. and 8th. she did not complain of any pain about the Fracture, only of a little Cough, and a great itching about the private parts; and therefore she took often in a day Syrup of Violets, of Liquorice
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:154387:191"/> and Tincture of Roses mixed together: to the Back and private parts, for their itching, I applied after a Fomentation with fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, white Oyntment and the Linimentum Simplex. On the 10th. day, I unbound the Wound, and bound it up again, with the Cerate of Diapalma perforated, and three rowlers passed through it: and a sufficient number of Bolsters and Splents; The bolsters Being first pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out in red-Wine▪ and by this means, upon occasion, I could look upon the part every day, without taking off the rowlers; her lower Belly was very much swelled, and very hard from the Navel down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to which I applyed, three days together, a Cataplasm made of the Powder of Mallows, crums of Bread, Milk, and fresh Butter. On the 14th. the swelling and hardness decreased, and remitted. The Patient upon an Abscess coming to suppuration in her Buttock, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Strangury and very sharp pain about the Os Sacrum. On the 20th. the Abscess being broken and the Ulcer cleansed, the Strangury and pain went away, but because the Ulcer on the Buttock did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire dayly applications, the broken part could not be kept in rest till the 30th. day, at which time the Patient complained of nothing. On the 40th. a new Abscess arose under the Ham, which coming to suppurate, was very painfull, and upon breaking cast out a very stinking matter, and therefore I injected, through a siphon, a Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Roots of Orice, round Birthwort, Scordium, Speedwell, Carduus, and Hony of Roses; upon which the Violent pain and stinking ceased. I dressed the Fracture again with Medicines conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Bone and Wound, with the Cerate of Diapalma, with row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers with holes through them, and long bolsters, and splents. On the 60. she complained of so great a pain about the Wound that she could scarce speak without sheeding of tears; and said that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nights she had seen a Spirit which was falsly reported, to walk in that Cloister, and that it caused her whole Body and the Bed to shake, and was the cause of her pain, but I suppose, that the pain took its Original partly from the Ulcer on the Buttock, which was cleansed every day and so moved, discomposed and troubled the broken part: and partly from a Portion of the Bone, which in such cases, used to Skale off about this time. On the 18. of <hi>January</hi> 1643. she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of terrible pains about the Wound on the Thigh, and unbind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and looking upon the Wound, I found out with my Probe a sharp peice of Bone, which continually pricked the flesh, and excited these great pains; therefore I presently dilated the Wound sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my incision Knife. And on the 19th. I took hold of that part of the bone which was separated with the teeth of my pincers and drew it out. <hi>Tab.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>Fig.</hi> IX. On the 20th. day, the whole Thigh was less than the days before, and the pricking pain intermitted. After the taking away of the Bone, I bound up the thigh with the

On the 16th. The Wound being again unbound and looked upon, all things went on well, not any pain or Tumour appeared; and laudable matter, and in a small quantity, came out of the Wound; and therefore I sprinkled upon the Bone which had lost its membrane, a Pouder of the Roots of long Birth-wort and Orice, I applied to the Wound a Sarcotick, and bound up the Leg again with the Diapalm, the Rowlers, Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Splents. This day he played at Cards, and moved the Case up and down, and distorted the the whole Shin-bone to the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:154387:193"/> left. On the 17th. In the morning, he complained of the Case pressing upon the outward part, under his Knee, below the Head of the Fibula; and looking upon the Leg, I found an Extuberance, and therefore unbinding the Wound, I touched it, and perceived a Fracture of the Fibula, which without doubt Nature would have Consolidated, if he had kept his Leg always unmoved.</p>
               <p>On the 20th. I applied an Iron Plate, that it might somewhat drive in the Extuberance of the Fibula towards the Tibia, which it did, but I foretold that a piece of the Bone would come away. I put upon the Fractured Tibia which went on well; the Pouder of Orice, with dry Lint, and put the whole Leg into its Case, being bound up with the Cerate of Diapalm, the Rowlers, Boulsters, Splents. On the 25th. The Patient complained of the Fracture of the Fibula; which being looked upon, I found a Bone which did somewhat prick the Skin, and therefore I drew the Cerate, Bandage, and Boulster, somewhat to the right, to provide against the pain, caused by the pricking of the Bone. On the 6th. of <hi>January,</hi> 1644. The Fractured Tibia began to be confirmed, and the little Bone of the Fibula came in sight; to which I applied the Pouder of Orice, and long Birth-wort with Lint; and bound up the Leg, with the Cerate of Diachalcitis, the Boulsters, Iron Plate, and Rowlers: that the Leg might acquire its former streightness. On the 16th. of <hi>January,</hi> I applied to the Wound of the Tibia, Lint, Diapalma, the Rowlers, Boulsters, and Splents. The Fracture of the Fibula fent forth white digested matter, I took out a little sharp Bone with the Pincers, and bound up the Leg, as the days before. On the 5th. of <hi>February,</hi> Nature had separated a little Bone of the Fibula; and the flesh began to grow: therefore I bound up the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer slackly, with Lint, The Ceratum Divinum, and the Rowlers, and put the Part affected into the Case. On the 25th. For an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescence of flesh, I sprinkled Pouder of burnt Alum upon the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; which being consumed: <hi>March</hi> the 4th. I drew out another piece of Bone, and dressed the Ulcer with dry Linnen, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Divinum; and placed the whole part, bound up as the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. On the 24th. Upon irregular Dyet, the matter was green, and the Ulcer spread it self; and therefore I ordered this Laxative Wine.</p>

At length, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wounded Artery, a burnt Spunge, and Pouder of prepared Chrysolite, and the Astringent Pouder of <hi>Galen,</hi> with the white of an Egg; and bound it up with a convenient Bandage, and put into it. the Instrument made of a Plate of Mettal, <hi>Tab.</hi> XLIII.

On the 8th. &amp; 9th. days, his Arm to the middle part of the Cubius, and Radius. was inflamed; and in the evening took a Glister. On the 10th. day he was better, and yellow matter issued through the Rowlers. On the 11th. he slept well all the night. On the 12th. the Wound being unbound, white matter flowed out; and the Wound appeared larger, by reason of the concreted blood taken out, as in an Aneurism, and the putting in of the Spunge. The Tendons of the Muscles, called Perforan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, came in sight, inflamed, painful, and tending to putrifaction. The Wound therefore being cleansed, without taking out of the Spunge, I applied the former remedies to the Artery; and the Wound being bound up with the Bandage, I shut it up with the Pin of the Instrument. In the mean time, cooling, and moistening Syrups were not omitted: Emulsion. of Waters, and appropriated Seeds, Magistery of red Corral, and Syrup of Violets.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JOhannes Ferher</hi> of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> a <hi>Swedish</hi> Souldier, about the 24th. Year of his Age; had a swelling arose in the inward part of his right Thigh; which in the space of two years, grew to such a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: that it was as big as three Mens Heads, and hindred his going. This Excrescence, a certain Empirick, corroded with a Caustick, that the matter might get out, designing afterwards to Consolidate the Ulcer; but finding no fluid matter, the Empirick fled away, and left the Patient destitute of all help. In the Year, 1634. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient came to <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> and desired help of <hi>Johannes Georgius Bauler,</hi> a Chirurgion; who when he could not Consolidate this foul Ulcer,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:154387:198"/> with any Medicines. By my advice, and the advice of <hi>George Riedlin,</hi> he took hold of the painful ulcerated swelling, with the Pincerrs, and cut it out with a Knife red hot, and the Eschar coming out, the Ulcer was fairly Cicatrized with the Ceratum Divinum, see, <hi>Tab.</hi> XXXV. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. Looking into the substance of the swelling cut off, which was fleshy and full of Veins, and Arteries. We enquired of the Patient, whether he were naturally so lean, or no? he answered, that before the rising, and encrease of this swelling, he was rather full bodied, whereby we were informed, that this swelling had received, and detained, most of the Aliment, which should have nourished the whole Body. Being recovered and about to leave <hi>Ʋlme,</hi> I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to use a slender Dyet; and every month to apply six Cupping Glasses to his Back, with scarification: till by degrees, the habit of the Body might be accustomed to assimulate the blood to it self, which before Nature was accustomed to transmit for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of the Tumour. The young Man observed these directions diligently for half a year, and lived in good health to the Year, 1644. At which time, being in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army, he visited me, and gave me many thanks for my advice.</p>

Things being thus, at the first visit, for want of other Medicines, these following were applied. I injected with a Siphon into the Wound of the right Leg, Oyl of Violets, mixed with the white of an Egg, and put in small Tents, done over with the same Medicine; over that I applied the Cerate of Diapalm, and a Cataplasm made of Barly-Meal, Mallows-meal, White-bread and Milk, and the Rowler with two Heads. Then I set the left Leg, as well as it was possible, and poured in the white of an Egg, and Oyl of Violets, shaken up together; and put into the holes Tents of dry Linnen wreathed, and over that, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palm, and the for-mentioned Cataplasm, and bound it up with the
